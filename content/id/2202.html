height="2976" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was fortunate to accompany a group of twenty-four exchange students from a local university. Some of them came from countries as far as Singapore. While up in the North, the <em>Aurora Borealis</em> might be a common sight, for tourists, it is still pretty much a calculated risk that it might be a fruitless journey. The night skies were overcast on the first night that they arrived, and it was bitterly cold for folks used to tropical weather, but they persisted. On their second night, there was a minor emergency that delayed a few of them from heading out to the remote site for viewing the <em>Northern Lights</em>, but again, they were determined. Within minutes of their arrival at the viewing site, there was a sudden break in the cloudy skies that coincided with a display of greens and purples that illuminated in the heavens. What a treat!</p><p>As we near the end of 2022, I&#x27;d like to reflect on the year&#x27;s challenges and milestones.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="published-a-second-book">Published a Second Book<a class="hash-link" href="#published-a-second-book" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>In 2021, I had started work and finished two chapters for a would be <em>Pro Oracle Application Express</em> along with a few other community members. However, that book never materialized and was cancelled by the publisher. Not willing to throw away the work that I had done, I did the unthinkable of asking the publisher if I could complete a book under a very different title. One that would cover different <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</em></a> (OCI) services that could be used in an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Application Express</em></a> (APEX) application.</p><p>Midway through the book, I was told that the esteemed <a href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/helihelskyaho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heli Helskyaho</a> would be the book&#x27;s technical reviewer. And since I had some chapters on integrating APEX with OCI AI Service and Machine Learning planned, I figured, why not ask if she would be more interested on being a co-author instead. That was the best decision ever! Heli&#x27;s a great person to work with. She&#x27;s dedicated, hardworking, and always optimistic. I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to complete the book on time had she not gotten involved.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Book Cover" src="/assets/images/978-1-4842-8170-3-094ac9f31d9ecd1bdbca443782c18185.jpg" width="827" height="1180" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We published the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8170-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Extending Oracle Application Express with Oracle Cloud Features</em></a> in September 2022. Book projects are very demanding, and more often than not, would fail without strong external support. I am first of all very grateful to Heli for sharing this burden with me. I also want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gennick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Gennick</a>, who has since moved from Apress to Manning. Jonathan&#x27;s a great editor to work with and very experienced. He&#x27;s been a great guide for both the books I published through Apress, and will miss working with him.</p><p>Anyone who actively writes on the OCI without company support, and <strong>was</strong> not an <a href="https://ace.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle ACE</a> Director, would know that it is tough justifying the monetary costs of experimenting with its services. Fortunately for us, we had some support through <a href="https://linktr.ee/iaasgeek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guillermo Ruiz</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boenglish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bo English-Wiczling</a>. Not just with resources, but the access to Oracle Product Managers and early access to OCI Services. Thank you &quot;G&quot; and Bo.</p><p>Finally, much thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-cannell-thtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen Cannell</a> for replacing Heli as the book&#x27;s technical reviewer. Thanks for taking time to read through all our chapters thoroughly, and offering many value advices and suggestion to improve the quality of the publication.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="travels-and-conferences">Travels and Conferences<a class="hash-link" href="#travels-and-conferences" title="Direct link to heading">â</a></h2><p>It was stressful, but refreshing, to be travelling to conferences again.

After a two-year hiatus, we were once again able to gather to share knowledge, and meet old friends and colleagues.

The primary reason for our trip was to officiate and sign a Memorandum of Understanding (./assets/MoU) between <a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanyang Polytechnic</a> (NYP) and Insum.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="MoU signed between NYP and Insum" src="/assets/images/nyp-mou-cdcee5f4fc18cb19b4e0c39ab11065da.jpeg" width="4032" height="2268" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We also took the opportunity to introduce APEX and OCI to the local community through a half-day seminar with speakers from Oracle, NYP, and Insum.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Introducing APEX and OCI" src="/assets/images/orclapex-in-singapore-seminar-41338ecd796ea1bff02d083c972577b7.jpeg" width="4032" height="2268" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It was also a great opportunity to meet the NYP interns that we have trained and continue to train.

We had some good times. Think of those good times. We are going to meet again someday, but right now, don&#x27;t be sad because I&#x27;m over here, <!-- -->[and]<!-- --> you&#x27;re there. Continue to live a good life while you&#x27;re there, and we&#x27;ll meet again someday.&quot;</em> ~ Joe Buffalo Child [Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp7ucghevOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet the North</a>]</p><p>Joel, I missed you at all the events I attended this year. Meeting you in person has always been the highlight of my trips to Kscope and OpenWorld. I hope I have made you proud.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_mRVl"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/content/tags/oracle">oracle</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/content/tags/community">community</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/content/tags/oracleace">oracleace</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/content/tags/getinvolved">getinvolved</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/content/tags/bethelight">bethelight</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/content/id/2301"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">I Am Obsolete</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/content/id/2201"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Speak My Language</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#published-a-second-book" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Published a Second Book</a></li><li><a href="#travels-and-conferences" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Travels and Conferences</a><ul><li><a href="#kscope22" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Kscope22</a></li><li><a href="#ocw22" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">OCW22</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#singapore" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Singapore</a></li><li><a href="#oracle-ace-director-award" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Oracle ACE Director Award</a></li><li><a href="#the-northern-lights" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Northern Lights</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/content">Latest</a></li><li class="footer__item">
