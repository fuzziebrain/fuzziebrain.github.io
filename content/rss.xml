Yesterday, Oracle <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-announces-availability-oci-generative-ai-service-2024-01-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the general availability of the OCI Generative AI (GenAI) service. In my final blog post last year, I briefly looked at the beta information that was available to the public, and suggested how you can quite easily add powerful GenAI capability in <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> applications by calling the REST APIs using <code>APEX_WEB_SERVICE</code>. With the service in GA, I am now finally able to take a deeper dive and hopefully, help you get started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-what-you-need-to-know">First, What You Need to Know...<a class="hash-link" href="#first-what-you-need-to-know" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The GenAI service is the newest of Oracle's portfolio of AI-focused OCI offerings. At this time, the service is only available in the US Midwest (Chicago) region. If you aren't already subscribed to this region, you can easily do this through the OCI Console. If you are on a trial account, and Chicago's not your home region, you might have to request for a service limit increase. In my personal experience, it can be an uphill task.</p><p>Unlike many of the Oracle AI services like Language, Vision, and Speech, costs of this service is not based solely on API calls. It is a combination of the serving mode, number of requests, the model used, and the length of both inputs and outputs. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/costestimator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCI Cost Estimator</a> is your "goto" website for estimating your costs, but here's a quick breakdown of each available model.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Cost (CAD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cohere (small)</td><td>0.05</td></tr><tr><td>Cohere (large)</td><td>0.26</td></tr><tr><td>Llama2-70</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>Embedding</td><td>0.01</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rates are based on 1 request with an input and output length of 1. If you're familiar with other similar GenAI services, I believe this is akin to tracking input and output tokens. To track my costs, I would think of adding a table to store the input and output lengths of each request. Thereafter, it would be a fairly trivial task to understand and forecast your usage, and hey, maybe even bill your customers. 😉</p><p>You could also monitor your usage and costs using the OCI Cost Analysis tool. Filtering on the service <code>GENERATIVE_AI</code>, you will find that each model's usage and costs are tracked separately.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Example of GenAI usage in OCI Cost Analysis." src="/assets/images/cost-analysis-826088a79b4e981c814922dee8fd4d40.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To use the service, either you are an OCI administrator, or belong to an IAM (Identity and Access Management) group that has been granted access to the service. An IAM policy with the following statement should do the trick.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">allow group &lt;group-name&gt; to manage generative-ai-family in compartment &lt;compartment-name&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong></p><p>For the purpose of calling the GenAI inference tasks, I have found that the verb <em>use</em> is probably sufficient.

This is a highly compute intensive task that often requires a GPU compute cluster to complete the learning process within the 21st century. I won't go into details in this post except to say that users can provision dedicated "AI" clusters to train and host models. And it looks like the product development team made a good decision to split the inference and management APIs into two different categories: <em>Generative AI Service Inference API</em> and <em>Generative AI Service Management API</em>.</p><p>Let's delve into the inference APIs that provide us the same set of tasks that was discussed in the <a href="/content/a-yearful-of-ai-but-whats-next">previous writeup</a>. The first thing to note is that the endpoint URL is now <code>https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com</code>. The inputs and outputs have also changed from what was in the beta documentation, so please ignore almost everything that I wrote in the last post about them. "Almost" because the methodology remains unchanged.</p><p>Let's look at the <em>GenerateTextResult</em> task/action for starters. When the GenAI service was first announced at Oracle CloudWorld 2023, the general expectation was that only <a href="https://cohere.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cohere</a> models were supported. So, it was a pleasant surprise that we now also have Meta's <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Llama2</a> 70B parameter model available for text generation tasks.</p><p>As a reminder, there are currently three capabilities that the GenAI supports:</p><ul><li>Text generation</li><li>Text summarization; and</li><li>Text embeddings</li></ul><p>To see a full list of supported pretrained models, and if you can afford it, custom models, go to the playground, look for the button <em>View model details</em>, and click it. There's an API for it, but why bother. 😉 You should find the list of model names (labelled <em>1</em> in the diagram) and OCIDs (<em>2</em>), either of which you will need to invoke the REST APIs, so take a note of them.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Available model details." src="/assets/images/model-details-96892595834ab21606046e3c8f7e7219.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For my quick demo, I'm going to use the Llama2 model, and if you're familiar with its usage, there are certain terms and conditions that you need to agree to. You'll see this when you switch the model in the playground the first time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Aggreement to the terms of use for Llama2 is required." src="/assets/images/llama2-agreement-4e8f7ed9c7ee0b0dc15241adfdb52eac.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>My goal is to replace the marketing folks at the company I work at, Contoso Food Enterprises Inc.

            <description><![CDATA[As 2023 draws to a close, I reflect on year where frontier models dominate the news and focus in the industry, and my aspirations for 2024.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A beautiful winter sunrise in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada." src="/assets/images/sunrise-whitehorse-1280x720-c751de502eb414ff30940c710ca94c4e.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the last one year since <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a> popularised <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generative AI</a>, a lot of the excitement and intrigue have been centred on the generative power of large language models (LLMs) or foundational models. Understandably so. However, the generative power of this models only cover a segment of business needs. The underlying promise of these frontier models is in its ability to "understand" natural language, and that to me, is where we will find more utility.</p><p>For the last few years at <a href="https://www.insum.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insum</a>, we've had an almost biannual tradition of reviewing what's been going on in the AI/ML space, in particular, around what Oracle has been doing to provide innovative solutions and tools. If you missed those, I have provided the links below. In the absence of an updated review, I am hoping that this final 2023 blog post would serve somewhat as a stopgap.</p><p>In late 2020, we did an interview with world-renowned ML expert, <a href="https://helifromfinland.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heli Helskyaho</a>, where we discussed about AI and its impact on society.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p><a href="http://montylatiolais.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monty Latiolais</a> prophetically asked about whether AI could be used to improve developer productivity. At Insum, we had looked at <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub CoPilot</a> in its beta days, thanks to <a href="https://ar.linkedin.com/in/fedegaete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federico Gaete</a>. However, at that time, we found that it provided limited help to us as it was trained over public repositories, and PL/SQL is overwhelmingly underrepresented. We haven't given up.</p><p>It is exciting that Oracle is working towards a "no code" platform 😉. In this <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/post/generative-ai-apex-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, the authors outline the various facets where AI will assist Oracle APEX and citizen developers create applications and write SQL code. And not to forget, on the Oracle Autonomous Database, there already is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/sql-generation-ai-autonomous.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Select AI</a>. I had <a href="/content/speaking-ai-to-your-oracle-database">written previously</a> on my experience, and am still anxiously waiting for the feature that allows you to use a self-hosted LLM.</p><p>In early 2022, I did a one-to-one interview with <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/marcruel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Ruel</a>, and we had discussed how we can quite easily build "AI APEX applications" by calling the various Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI services' REST APIs, and/or use AutoML to train and deploy in-database ML models.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>Have you tried them out?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oci-generative-ai">OCI Generative AI<a class="hash-link" href="#oci-generative-ai" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</strong></p><p>While I, the author, am an active participant in Oracle's Generative AI service beta programme, it is important to clarify that the following content does not contain any exclusive or proprietary information that is not already publicly documented in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) documentation. Oracle makes extensive resources available to its users, and I encourage everyone to review these materials for accurate and up-to-date information regarding the capabilities and usage of the Generative AI service. The intention of this text is to provide an example or context rather than to disclose any confidential or undisclosed features.</p></blockquote><p>2024 will be a year that we should see Oracle releasing new services and features that target the generative AI space. One of them is the Oracle <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generative AI</a> (GenAI) service, a cloud native service that was first revealed at Oracle CloudWorld 2023. I was privileged to have attended an introductory session by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisecabrera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luis Cabrera-Cordon</a>, where he demonstrated some of its features using the OCI Console.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Luis demonstrating the GenAI service during a session at Oracle CloudWorld 2023." src="/assets/images/genai-ocw-2023-edcd6330052e77a155786db50c7c7393.png" width="2560" height="1602" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you've used any other similar "LLM-as-an-API" service, then the user interface would be familiar to you. It allows you to enter a prompt and adjust parameters like <em>temperature</em> and <em>maximum tokens</em>.</p><p>The playground on the OCI Console looks like a great tool to give the feature a quick spin, try things out, and to see how it works. However, the real proof of the pudding is using it inside an application, for example, in Oracle APEX. And like the other Oracle AI services, you can call these models using the OCI REST APIs.</p><p>From the API documentation, the key endpoints that us developers would look at using are</p><ul><li><em>GenerateTextResult</em></li><li><em>SummarizeTextResult</em>; and</li><li><em>EmbedTextResult</em></li></ul><p>Like other OCI REST APIs, the required and optional parameters are passed to the endpoints as a JSON payload in the request body, and the results will be returned as a JSON response.</p><div class="language-json codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

I am particularly interested in the <code>serviceMode</code> attribute. The value can be either of the type <em>OnDemandServingMode</em> or <em>DedicatedServingMode</em>. Both have the common attribute <code>servingType</code> that is a string value of either <code>ON_DEMAND</code> or <code>DEDICATED</code>. The on-demand serving mode additionally requires the attribute <code>modelId</code> that you can obtain by querying the endpoint <em>ListModels</em> (under <em>ModelCollection</em> in the documentation). This returns a list of elements of type <em>ModelSummary</em>.

This diversification of hardware options offers hope for more accessible and affordable fine-tuning opportunities in the near future. Nevertheless, let us not forget to keep a close eye on the ecological impact of these advancements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oracle-ai-vector-search">Oracle AI Vector Search<a class="hash-link" href="#oracle-ai-vector-search" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Unlike the GenAI service, not a lot has been published on this upcoming Oracle Database 23c feature. And I might stress "upcoming". When news first broke (also) at Oracle CloudWorld 2023, it wasn't clear if the vector data type and its powerful search features were part of the 23c general availability (GA) that was announced at the same time. If you missed it, here's the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-integrated-vector-database-augments-generative-ai-2023-09-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="embeddings-and-knowledge-graphs">Embeddings and Knowledge Graphs<a class="hash-link" href="#embeddings-and-knowledge-graphs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the absence of publicly available content on the AI vector search database feature, let's focus instead on an important concept, <em>embeddings</em>. Embeddings in LLMs are a vector of numbers that somewhat represent meaning and context in a body of text. These vectors are derived from the parameters or the weights of a LLM used to generate these embeddings. They can be used to encode and decode both inputs and outputs of your inferencing task. These vectors are what powers "semantic" search and Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG), and based on the press release, we can expect to perform these tasks when the AI vector search feature becomes generally available.</p><p>While I await for AI vector search to be generally available, there are a few frameworks and alternate vector database solutions that I am currently looking at, including most recently, the newly release <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCI Cache with Redis</a> service that didn't work out as I had expected. 😦 More on that in a 2024 blog post.</p><p>One other area that I am looking to spend some time on in 2024 is on the subject of <em>knowledge graph embeddings</em>. I first learned about the Semantic Web and the power of ontologies, knowledge representation, and linked data at a 2006 bioinformatics conference in Boston, where I crashed on a special interest group meeting at the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. Aside from seeing the back of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Tim Berners-Lee's</a>, I was truly inspired by the brains around this subject, and remembered listening to a presentation on what would later become <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase_(database)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freebase</a>.</p><p>In my Kscope17 presentation, <a href="https://www.insum.ca/portfolio/enriching-oracle-apex-applications-semantics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Enriching Oracle APEX Applications with Semantics</em></a>, I described simple changes to how data is presented so that software agents may access and consume data meaningfully. As we continue to produce yottabytes of data, we should not neglect the importance of curating, documenting, and enriching (and securing) data. Data without meaning is going to be garbage. And the essence of embedding meaning in data is ever increasingly important in this new era of AI. I'm placing my bets that the development and use of knowledge graphs and frontier models is the next disrupter in the AI space. If anyone's looking for a part-time PhD candidate, can I please volunteer? 🙋‍♀️😉</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It's been an accelerating year for AI developments and I don't think anyone's going to see the end of it in 2024. For me personally, I continue to be conflicted with the current developments and hype around generative AI. While it presents a lot of promise, it shouldn't dwarf the usefulness of traditional ML approaches that I feel still provides a lot of immediate utility. It is also seemingly a technology for those who can afford it, and it has potential to take jobs away from people who do what some might call mundane.</p><p>Take the banner art that I use for my previous few blogs for example. In case it wasn't obvious enough, I have relied on generating the images using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stable Diffusion XL</a> model, when I used to scour online repositories of royalty-free photos. For more professional websites, I'm sure they source these from companies selling stock art from contributors, providing a source of income for people passionate about photography or graphic art.</p><p>AI is great, and I'm passionate about what it can do for civilisation. But in 2024, and in the years following, I do hope that we can all continue to remember that technology should be used to improve the lives of all, and not some.</p><p>With that, I'll end this blog post and 2023. For those whom I have had the privilege of working with this year, a huge "Thank you". It's been a great year, and I look forward to our continued collaboration to make this world a better place for you, me, and those whom we serve.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Wefie at OCW23." src="/assets/images/happy-new-year-3e154e40bf876197419a84e7b55442b3.jpg" width="3264" height="1836" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Happy New Year Everyone!<br>

I found an alternative, and you will read about it later in this article.</p><p>To demonstrate its utility, I create a simple <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> application that reads NFC tags using the <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Web NFC</em></a> API, and then displays an image generated by the deployed machine learning (ML) model.</p><p>I called this toy application "Amiibo Art". The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amiibo</a> was created by <em>Nintendo</em> to bridge games with the real world using toys, figurines, and collectibles that embedded a radio-frequency tag. I wanted this APEX application to interact with the real world, and then generate a collectible. If you missed it, here's the screen recording of the application in action:</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deploying-the-model">Deploying the Model<a class="hash-link" href="#deploying-the-model" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the OCI Data Science platform did not provide me an easy way to deploy the Stable Diffusion XL model. I found an open-source project called <a href="https://pinferencia.underneathall.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pinferenia</em></a> that I could use to deploy a Hugging Face pipeline to perform the text-to-image generation task. The code below can be executed and deployed on an OCI Compute, and a GPU, while not required, is desired.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup-the-server-environment">Setup the

NFC-Enabled Web Application<a class="hash-link" href="#the-nfc-enabled-web-application" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I created an Oracle APEX application with the following features:</p><ol><li><strong>Page 1.</strong> On the home page, the user scans a NFC tag containing a single text record that stores the prompt to submit to the deployed model.</li><li>An administrative tool that allows an administrator to:<ol><li><strong>Page 2</strong>. List tags in the inventory with buttons to manage or write prompts to a tag.</li><li><strong>Page 3</strong>. Register and manage a tag.</li><li><strong>Page 4</strong>. Write prompts to a tag.</li></ol></li></ol><p>To keep this blog post readable, I will focus on two key aspects that allow the user to scan and generate an image.</p><p>First, the <em>Ajax Callback</em> process that is called when an NFC tag containing a valid prompt is scanned successfully. Again, follow the embedded comments to understand what this code does.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

Then, build an Oracle APEX application that users may use to submit feedback and have their reviews automatically scored.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="LLMs for analyzing customer reviews." src="/assets/images/llms-for-analyzing-customer-reviews-5f8f8c44197d2e7aba542aea8d90582d.png" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In my previous <a href="/content/predict-the-rugby-world-cup-2023-winner">post</a>, I wrote about how a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scikit-learn</a> machine learning (ML) could be trained and deployed on the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a> (OCI) <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science</a> service. The model is deployed on the service's managed infrastructure, allowing developers to simply call a HTTP endpoint to perform ML model inference on the submitted data. In my latest adventure, I built an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> application that takes product reviews and then automatically ranks the review using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) available through <a href="https://huggingface.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face</a>.</p><p>While OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> has largely dominated the news headlines when it comes to <em>Generative AI</em>, there is a plethora of LLMs out there. Many of them are open sourced and readily available through hubs like Hugging Face. There are a bunch of tutorials that introduce the platform including the available datasets, models, Python, and JavaScript libraries. In this post, I will use the example from their tutorial on fine-tuning a pre-trained model.</p><p>The goal is to use the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp review</a> dataset to fine-tune <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BERT</a>, specifically, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distilbert-base-uncased</a> model, to assign a rank that describes the sentiment expressed in a body of text.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="provisioning-the-tools">Provisioning the Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#provisioning-the-tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Machine learning tasks can be performed on a CPU, but more often than not, we have a huge performance gained by using a graphical processing unit (GPU). For most people, that's going to be a Nvidia chip. On the OCI, we currently have a choice of the P100, V100, and more recently, A10 and A100. I went with an A10 as it was newer, cheaper than the A100, and has adequate amount of GPU memory. And, more importantly, the tenancy that I was on had sufficient number of GPUs assigned.</p><p>You can check your tenancy's service limits to see if you can provision a GPU instance. The resource that you will need is either <code>gpu-a10-count</code> if you wish to run the training on an OCI Compute instance, or <code>ds-gpu-a10-count</code> for an OCI Data Science notebook. These limits are assigned differently for Compute instance and Data Science notebooks. If your tenancy is either a trial, or a <em>PAYG</em> (Pay-as-you-go) account, then these limits are likely <code>0</code>. For <em>PAYG</em>, you could try making a service limit request, but for trial accounts, it's an uphill battle. And for accounts with a <em>Universal Credits</em>, you might find <code>16</code> is the number for <code>gpu-a10-count</code>. Make a service limit request for <code>ds-gpu-a10-count</code> if you wish to run the training in a GPU-powered notebook session.</p><p>I initially did not have access to GPU resources on OCI Data Science, so I had provisioned a Compute with a GPU, and then all I needed was to install <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miniconda</a>, and I was good to go!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fine-tune-the-llm">Fine-tune the LLM<a class="hash-link" href="#fine-tune-the-llm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In OCI Data Science, you can probably use the <a href="https://conda.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conda</a> environments <code>generalml_p38_cpu_v1</code> or <code>pytorch20_p39_gpu_v2</code> (if you have a GPU instance provisioned) for fine-tuning the model. However, for deployment, a GPU instance probably isn't necessary as the time needed to complete the inference is relatively much shorter.</p><p>If you do use the Oracle-provided Conda environments, please note that you might need to add any missing dependencies that are specific for working with Hugging Face models and datasets. For me, I opted to create a custom Conda environment as I had started out training the model on a GPU-powered compute instance. This environment was published and later used for the model deployment. Below is the Conda environment file I used.</p><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

This is an easy-to-use API, and I have previously written on how to use it for <a href="/content/revolutionising-language-learning">performing translation tasks</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sentiment analysis results from invoking the OCI Language pre-trained model." src="/assets/images/oci-ai-language-results-9e4d6745bd2b0bc951c4ebee414c431f.png" width="2880" height="1800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>However, with the fine-tuned LLM, my goal was to provide a review score, ranging from 1 to 5, based on the reviewer's comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Woman in a crystal ball" src="/assets/images/woman-in-crystal-ball-196996a4ae30f625defb6121c704b8bb.png" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This has been one of those weeks where I couldn't wait to wake up and get to work. Just last week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luc-demanche-17107b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luc Demanche</a> threw me a challenge and asked that I help develop an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> application that could be used to predict the winner of the <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rugby World Cup 2023</a> (RWC2023). I couldn't resist the challenge!</p><p>The first challenge we had attempting to predict the outcome of a sports match was data. As with any machine learning (ML), obtaining ample high quality training data greatly influences the accuracy of the prediction models. This can sometimes be hard to find as professional sports is a lucrative market, and the highest quality data, such as player statistics, game performance, and match history, are typically collected, managed, and made available through paid channels. Something that I didn't have access to.</p><p>Fortunately, my French teammate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-moreaux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Moreaux</a> stumbled on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaggle</a> dataset that contained historical match data that was scrapped from <a href="https://wikipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> and aggregated by a contributor. The dataset contained minimal data on different rugby matches played since 1871. At first glance, there wasn't really much to work on, but fortunately, another contributor had presented a notebook that demonstrated how we can enrich the data and help better predict the match outcomes. This included calculating features such as a team's ranking point and form. This was good enough for the proof-of-concept application that we needed to build.</p><p>It was only a few months ago that I sat for and passed the <a href="https://education.oracle.com/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-data-science-2023-professional/pexam_1Z0-1110-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science 2023 Professional</a>, so this was the perfect opportunity to put training to practice!</p><p>Without any hesitation, I provisioned a new <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a> (OCI) <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science</a> project, and worked on training the prediction model using a notebook session. The notebook session is Oracle's managed <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> environment for data scientists to perform exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and preparation, model training, validation, and deployment. I also utilise the powerful <a href="https://accelerated-data-science.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Accelerated Data Science</a> (ADS) Python library that allows me to perform a wide variety of activities including interfacing with the OCI, accessing data stored in an <a href="https://oracle.com/autonomousdatabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a>, managing and deploying models. Just to name a few.</p><p>Once deployed, using the ML model in a web application is performed by invoking its HTTP endpoint. Of course, this being an OCI managed service, calls to the endpoints require signing. This is no different from calling any OCI REST APIs, and relies on creating the necessary OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, groups, policies, and generating the required API keys. Oracle APEX simplifies the signing process, and you will only need to create the required APEX web credentials and reference its static identifier during the web service call.

I have, unfortunately, left out much of the details as I'm rushing to have this post published before the semi-final games tomorrow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Joel and Friends" src="/assets/images/joel-and-friends-0b987932dec820c145c9add07d6121f9.jpg" width="1800" height="837" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I hope Joel doesn't mind that I used this image here to commemorate <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JoelKallmanDay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#JoelKallmanDay</a>. This picture was <a href="https://twitter.com/joelkallman/status/1192268209291976704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> by our dear friend, Joel Kallman, in 2019. Shortly after Mike Hichwa was presented with the first coin in the first series of the <a href="/content/id/1727">Oracle APEX Challenge Coin</a>.</p><p>I first approached Joel about this project on Thursday, January 3, 2019, at 3.05 PM Pacific Time. Presented the initial sketch of the coin, and sought his permission to use the Oracle APEX logo on the main face of the coin. Below is the initial sketch of both sides of the coin.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The initial sketch of the Oracle APEX challenge coin in 2019." src="/assets/images/artwork-original-06607c09988316cbefcc82775750ba80.png" width="652" height="270" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A minute later, I received an out-of-office reply saying:</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for your message.</p><p>I am on vacation until January 7, 2019 and will be unable to respond to email or voicemail during this period.  Happy New Year!</p><p>Joel</p></blockquote><p>At 5.44 PM that day, I unexpectedly received an reply from Joel granting me the needed permission to use the logo and included some suggestions for improvements. These were his exact words, double spaces after the period included.</p><blockquote><p>Please forgive me for offering my opinion where one wasn't solicited, but I have a suggestion about some of the words you have on the coin.  Two words seem to be inconsistent with the 4 others - namely  STANDARDS and ON-TIME.  While the other 4 words seem to describe APEX itself, these other two really don't.  How about RELIABLE or SCALABLE or PROVEN or GLOBAL or something like that?</p></blockquote><p>I finally settled on the six words that you see on the coin today, and they include Joel's suggestions of "RELIABLE" and "PROVEN". And that's what he was. I may be a nobody, but even on while on vacation, he took personal time to think, optimise, suggest, and respond to my email.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The updated sketch before it was sent to the vendor for the final artwork." src="/assets/images/artwork-updated-c1e89f5dc8106f35cd96fad9bf0c49a9.png" width="700" height="292" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I often remind people with a coin today, that they hold a piece of him. You "make Oracle great again" by adding value to people's lives through the magic you do with Oracle APEX.</p><p>The final two coins were presented to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paige-hanssen-6a8530109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paige Hanssen</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonnemeyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonja Meyer</a> at the recently concluded <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle CloudWorld 2023</a>. Congratulations to the both of them!</p><p>Like everything, there's an alpha and omega. I hereby proclaim that the Oracle APEX Challenge Coin project has come to a successful close. Our service, however, continues.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is likely made possible with a template wrapping the database metadata with the prompt, and then calling either the <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>OpenAI</em></a> or <a href="https://cohere.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cohere</em></a> APIs to generate the intended text.</p><p>This feature is already available on an <em>Oracle Autonomous Database</em> (ADB), and yes, that includes the <em>Always Free</em> instances that I use for the managing the <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle APEX</em></a> <a href="/content/id/1727"><em>Challenge Coin</em></a> registry. I know everyone's eager to try it out, and so am I! So here's a quick set of instructions to get you going.</p><p>The first thing that you'll need to do is make sure your application schema has the appropriate rights to use this feature. As the ADB <em>ADMIN</em> user, first add the Access Control Entry (ACE) for using the intended API. Also, grant the user access to both the <code>DBMS_CLOUD</code> and new <code>DBMS_CLOUD_AI</code> packages.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

Also, currently, I don't believe there's an APEX PL/SQL API that would allow us to create a report dynamically. Perhaps that might change some day. <strong>If you have thoughts about this, please reach out</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This technology is still very much in its infancy, but exciting nonetheless. Though I am on the fence if it's ready for prime time. I wouldn't put this in front of an uninformed user yet. To be fair, I have not tried this with the OpenAI LLM models. Maybe it'll do better. Or perhaps, I need the LLMs to suggest improvements to my data models. ;-) And that brings me to the final point - semantics! In the era of big data and machine learning, one concept that often gets brushed away is providing rich semantics to data and metadata. We have had OCI Data Catalog for a while now... how many of us actually use it? Or adding proper comments to the schema metadata, which was clearly lacking in my toy project. If that was included in the prompt, then perhaps I would have had better results.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="update-2023-09-24">Update <!-- -->[2023-09-24]<a class="hash-link" href="#update-2023-09-24" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>So, I was still trying to get <em>Select AI</em> to give me the correct answer to the question:</p><blockquote><p>How many coins have been sponsored?</p></blockquote><p>I did find the answer to my earlier question about whether or not comments were included in the prompt. There is one more profile attribute that can be added to the profile. The <code>comments</code> attribute supplies the LLM with comments in the <code>sys.all_col_comments</code> view. Unfortunately, table comments don't seem to be included. Adding comments describing what the tables and views represented didn't seem to help. I couldn't get it to ignore a view that was never going to tell you if a coin has been sponsored. It was also creating predicates on columns that didn't exist, so the third attribute I had tweaked was to specify what database objects are in the <code>object_list</code>.</p><div class="language-sql

I agree. However, aside from a lack of time, I had also wanted to find interesting ways for awardees to submit their claim of ownership. Over the last week, I had worked on making this dream of a "claims" map a reality with the use of the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a> (OCI) <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vision</a> AI service, more specifically, its custom model training feature.</p><p>Here's an early preview of the claims process in the <em>Claim My Oracle APEX Challenge Coin</em> application.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For those new to Oracle APEX, and those who have not been acquainted with the Oracle APEX Challenge Coin, it was a project I had started in early 2019 to support and acknowledge the value that developers bring to the world community. I had designed and minted a total of 200 coins over two years, and have since distributed almost all of them. As of now, there are only two more coins available for sponsorship. Read the original <a href="/content/id/1727">article</a> for more details and how to sponsor these challenge coins.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oci-vision">OCI Vision<a class="hash-link" href="#oci-vision" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The OCI Vision is one of several AI services available on the OCI. Three pre-trained models are available for developers to create intelligent applications that need to perform computer vision tasks, such as, image and text recognition. Using the pre-trained models, developers can use the OCI REST API to perform image classifications, object detections, and text detections. It also included document processing tasks like key-value pair extraction, and document classification. However, it has since been spun off to a separate offering called <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/document-understanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Document Understanding</a>. If you are interested to know more about using Document Understanding in Oracle APEX, please check out this <a href="https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle LiveLabs workshop</a> that I published in July, 2023.</p><p>OCI Vision uses <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep learning</a> (DL) approaches, and one of the key features of DL is the ability to perform <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transfer learning</a>. <em>TL;DR</em>, transfer learning is process that uses pre-trained, generalist models, and then perform additional training over specialised datasets. This significantly reduces the amount of time, and training data, needed to train a machine learning (ML) model for specific operational needs. For example, recognising an Oracle APEX Challenge Coin! The OCI Vision's custom model feature allows developers to fine-tune and train highly specialised computer vision (CV) models to perform either image classification or object detection tasks.</p><p>In this project, I will train a custom model for detecting the front and back sides of the coin.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prepare-the-dataset">Prepare the Dataset<a class="hash-link" href="#prepare-the-dataset" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Availability of large and high quality datasets are crucial to training good CV models that have high precision and recall. Since the project was launched, recipients have spontaneously posted their cherished gifts on social media. Hence, my first challenge was to scour the Internet for these photographs. There are only 200 coins ever minted, and not every recipient has posted a photo of their coin on social media. Thankfully, I was able to harvest about slightly over one hundred of such images. They include photos of the front and back of the coin, different lighting scenes, pose, and proportional sizes.</p><p>A prerequisite for performing custom model training is to create a data set in the  OCI <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/data-labeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Labeling</a> service. This is an OCI managed service that lets data scientists and developers to curate and label data that will be used to perform supervised ML training. Creating an image classification and object detection models is a supervised learning task.</p><p>Before creating the dataset, assemble and upload all the images to an OCI <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Object Storage</a> bucket. Once the images have been staged, the dataset created, and the records generated, you will need to work through all the images to mark and label the dataset records. Here's a quick demonstration of the data labelling process for object detection use:</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-model-training">Custom Model Training<a class="hash-link" href="#custom-model-training" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the OCI Vision custom models feature allows data scientists and developers to easily fine-tune a inference model for specialised use cases. After creating the dataset and labelling the 100+ images, next step is to create a project and then a custom model. Choose the appropriate model type for your business use case. For this application, I chose <em>Object detection</em>, and then moved on to select the dataset I had created with the Data Labeling service.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Choose model type." src="/assets/images/choose-model-type-b9fca9a6eb8a811cb7169a5f86e0b0d5.png" width="1280" height="400" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are more options to consider, including the desired training duration time. There are three options available: recommended, quick, and custom modes. In the early phases of the model training, I'd recommend using the quick mode, just to get a sense of how well the model might perform, given the quality and quantity of labelled samples in your dataset.</p><p>After the training is completed, the model detail will provide you the necessary metrics to decide if you need to repeat the process. The <em>precision</em> and <em>recall</em> are measurements typically used for judging the performance of ML models. If your model scores poorly, consider sourcing additional data for training and testing, or applying image transformations. Increasing the training duration may help, but sometimes, over-fitting a ML model may yield poorer results.</p><p>For convenience, in the lower half of the custom model details page, you will find a simple user interface for applying the custom model to source images.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-the-custom-model-in-an-application">Using the Custom Model in an Application<a class="hash-link" href="#using-the-custom-model-in-an-application" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The custom model is trained to recognise both the front and back of an Oracle APEX challenge coin. However, for this application, I will only need it to detect the back side of the coin. In addition to object detection, I will also have OCI Vision to perform text detection (optical character recognition), and extract the unique serial number found on every coin.</p><p>The flow of the application is as follows:</p><ol><li>User begins a new claim using a wizard.</li><li>User uploads a photo of the back of the coin, and chooses the unique serial number. A unique claims identifier is issued, and together with the submitted information, it is added to an APEX collection.</li><li>In the next step, the user will optionally provide a display name that will be rendered in the map. The user will also use the Oracle APEX geocoded address functionality to set the estimated location of the coin.</li><li>User confirms the details to be submitted.</li><li>Upon confirmation, the claim is created in the database.</li><li>The uploaded image is stored in the designated OCI Object Storage bucket.</li><li>The claim is then evaluated using the OCI Vision using its OCI REST API. This involves an HTTP <code>POST</code> to the endpoint: <code>https://vision.aiservice.{{REGION}}.oci.oraclecloud.com/20220125/actions/analyzeImage</code> (substituted <code>{{REGION}}</code> with the desired region).</li><li>The results of the REST call is evaluated. If the desired label and serial number text is found, with the minimum confidence score, then the claim's validation status is marked <code>PASS</code>. Otherwise, it is marked <code>FAIL</code>.</li><li>The map is refreshed, only displaying claims where the validation status value is <code>PASS</code>.</li></ol><p>This <em>AnalyzeImage</em> endpoint expects a JSON payload described by the <em>AnalyzeImagesDetails</em>. This payload is sent in the request body. Here's what it looks like:</p><div class="language-json codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>I'm finally finding more time, post-conference, to catch up on my writing. In this latest post, I'd like to talk about a presentation that I did at <a href="https://kscope23.odtug.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kscope23</a>, "Solving Everyday Problems with the Oracle Cloud". During the session, I had described and demonstrated how we can use the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</em></a> (OCI) <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AI services</em></a> and <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle APEX</em></a> to build compelling solutions, even for personal life challenges.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We are constantly bombarded by news about <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> (AI) and <em>Machine Learning</em> (ML), driving many of us seek to find a strong use case to take advantage of these technologies and use them in our work and personal projects. I am no exception.</p><p>A few years ago, I started learning the Japanese language using <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duolingo</a>, but had a lot of trouble remembering the Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji characters, same issues when I learned Mandarin in school. Back in the days, learning Mandarin was through rote learning, and that sometimes involved flashcards. In August 2021, I published an <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/learn/technical-articles/learning-languages-with-oracle-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> through the Oracle Developer Relations team, about how I had used a <a href="https://www.m5stack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M5Stack</a> IoT device and some OCI resources to build a self-updating electronic flashcard that I could place on the refrigerator door. However, constantly updating the content repository can be tedious.</p><p>Less than a year later, two developments at Oracle made it easier for me to enhance the data entry process with AI-based technologies, specifically, <em>Natural Language Processing</em> (NLP). First, the Speech service was released on Feb 23, 2022. Later, in October 2022, a second version of the Language service was released with a new feature for performing language translation tasks. Both these added features from Oracle AI provided me an opportunity to "use AI" to improve my approach for entering new Japanese words into my online personal word bank.</p><p>I had blogged about this project <a href="/content/id/2201">previously</a>, to celebrate the Joel Kallman Day last year. This follow-up article provides a technical deep dive to guide readers on how to implement as similar solution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-ai-enhanced-data-entry-workflow">New AI-Enhanced Data Entry Workflow<a class="hash-link" href="#new-ai-enhanced-data-entry-workflow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>"A picture speaks a thousand words", so here's are two workflow diagrams that provides a crude overview of how new words are entered today.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speech-to-text">Speech-to-Text<a class="hash-link" href="#speech-to-text" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned in my earlier post, when the speech service was first launched, it only supported the Waveform Audio File Format (WAV), and had strict rules on sample rates and channels. Today, the service now supports a much larger number of formats including <em>FLAC</em>, <em>OGG</em>, and <em>WEBM</em>. In the latest version of my application, only the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MediaStream Recording API</em></a> is used.</p><p>The audio capture and transcription job requests are performed through an Oracle APEX modal page shown below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Oracle APEX modal page for recording and transcribing audio." src="/assets/images/record-speech-modal-a556f4504c0203ca1cbd083f6bd024d3.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To start off, we will need some utility JavaScript functions, and for simplicity, I had declared this in the page's <em>Function and Global Variable Declaration</em>. Firstly, there's the <code>mediaRecorder</code> variable that stores the reference to the <em>MediaRecorder</em> object that we will instantiate at page load. It is followed by a simple utility functions that I had borrowed from <a href="https://apexplained.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Buytaert</a>. Reference to his blog post is in the comments.</p><div class="language-javascript codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

would instantiate the <em>MediaRecorder</em> object, and implement the callback function when recording is stopped. When that function is called, the recorded audio will be loaded into an embedded audio player, allowing the user to playback the recording. It will also call an AJAX callback (<code>TRANSCRIBE_AUDIO</code>) process that includes the audio MIME-type, and the recording as a base64-encoded string.

it to the target Object Storage bucket defined by the APEX substitution string <code>G_INPUT_BUCKET_NAME</code>. Once the file has been uploaded successfully, the Speech service transcription job is then created using a facade. The PL/SQL function takes in the input and output bucket names, as well as the audio filename, and returns the transcribed text. The function also has an optional parameter <code>p_source_language_code</code> that lets the developer specify the language used in audio recording. The default value is <code>en-US</code>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong></p><p>If you have not worked with the Object Storage service in APEX before, be sure to check out the LiveLabs <a href="https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workshop</a> I had prepared on this subject.

            <description><![CDATA[New features announced for Oracle Autonomous Database]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="New features announced for Oracle Autonomous Database" src="/assets/images/adb-new-features-alert-72ffee96d7288cea1c4da967cba9d29a.png" width="2140" height="592" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In case you missed it, Oracle recently announced the availability of a new feature for the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autonomous Database</a> (ADB) that allows developers and database administrators to send messages using either emails, <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a>, or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Teams</a> (Teams). At <a href="https://insum.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insum</a>, we use teams for internal communications and collaboration, and thus, you can appreciate my excitement when I heard about this feature release. Here's an early guide to getting started with <code>DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION</code> for those using Teams at their organisation.</p><blockquote><p>Before we begin, it is worthwhile to note that for <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a>, you can also send out emails and Slack/Teams using the <code>APEX_MAIL</code> and <code>APEX_WEB_SERVICE</code> PL/SQL APIs. This is an additional convenience feature that is provided with an ADB.</p></blockquote><p>Setting up <code>DBMS_CLOUD_NOTIFICATION</code> to send Teams messages and data requires a few preparatory steps. You may read the details <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/send-msteams-notifications.html#GUID-80ACCB33-DF2D-42D7-AC01-23670B5B90E4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> but this blog post would provide further guidance and issues I noted when working through the steps.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-a-teams-application">Create a Teams Application<a class="hash-link" href="#create-a-teams-application" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The first task that you will need to complete is to create a Teams application using the Teams <a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer portal</a>. Create a new application and provide the following details:</p><ul><li>App names<ul><li>Short name</li></ul></li><li>Descriptions<ul><li>Short description</li><li>Long description</li></ul></li><li>Version</li><li>Developer information<ul><li>Developer or company name</li><li>Website</li></ul></li><li>App URLs<ul><li>Privacy policy</li><li>Terms of use</li></ul></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Provide the basic information required for the new application." src="/assets/images/teams-app-basic-information-d36beebfe28554eb65c36f3d20df8c20.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Other than the <em>Application (client) ID</em>, you <strong>must</strong> enter the required information to ensure the application passes validation and can be published successfully.</p><p>Once you are satisfied with what you have entered, save the changes, and then return to the <em>Dashboard</em> to make sure there are no errors or warnings. Correct any if necessary.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-a-bot-and-configure-the-app-feature">Create a Bot and Configure the App Feature<a class="hash-link" href="#create-a-bot-and-configure-the-app-feature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Next, create a <em>Bot</em>. You can either do this by navigating to <em>Tools</em> &gt; <em>Bot management</em>, or from within the <em>Apps</em> interface, navigate to <em>App features</em> and then click <em>Bot</em>. There, you will find the link <em>Create a new bot</em>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create an app feature." src="/assets/images/teams-app-features-a95fb7715f6b15faf321fd2f4e561e5a.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Creating a bot is simple. You will only need to provide a name for the bot. After the bot is created, you will be redirected to the bot's details page. Navigate to the <em>Client secrets</em>, and then click the button <em>Add a secret client for your bot</em>. Store the generated client secret securely as it will only be displayed <strong>once</strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bot secret" src="/assets/images/bot-secret-f52cca82f1b99a6119be638a07d54996.png" width="2560" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Return to the <em>Bots management</em> page and note the <em>Bot ID</em> as well.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bot ID" src="/assets/images/bot-id-09b7f7e1f84ed2eb3ad1b8f874430098.png" width="2560" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After the bot has been created, return to the bot configuration in the app's feature page. Select the bot that you have just created, select the actions that the bot can do, and the scope.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bot app feature configuration" src="/assets/images/teams-app-bot-feature-configuration-03776b969a3614c531b5ea78ae29d6b7.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="publish-the-application">Publish the Application<a class="hash-link" href="#publish-the-application" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On the app's details page, navigate to <em>Publish</em> &gt; <em>Publish to org</em>. At the bottom of the page, there should be a button to submit the app for publication. Click it and inform the Teams administrator.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasks-for-azure-active-directory-administrators">Tasks for Azure Active Directory Administrators<a class="hash-link" href="#tasks-for-azure-active-directory-administrators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The next task involves defining the <em>API permissions</em> that the bot <strong>must</strong> have. If you do not have permission to access the <em>Azure Active Directory</em> (Azure AD) console, then please work with the administrator to complete this step.</p><p>When the bot was created, the platform automatically creates an <em>App registration</em> in Azure AD. You may access the app registrations using either <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Entra</a> or the main <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure portal</a>. Locate the app registration for the bot and then navigate to the <em>API permissions</em> page. Add the following permissions:</p><ul><li><code>Files.ReadWrite.All</code></li><li><code>Sites.ReadWrite.All</code></li><li><code>ChannelSettings.Read.All</code><sup>*</sup></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Required API permissions" src="/assets/images/azuread-api-permissions-and-grant-consent-9224d0cdecda0c1c5800bff09d570408.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> The Oracle documentation does not include <code>ChannelSettings.Read.All</code>. I will discuss this in a later section.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, click the <em>Grant admin consent for {{TENANT}}</em> link to allow the bot to access the specified APIs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasks-for-teams-administrators">Tasks for Teams Administrators<a class="hash-link" href="#tasks-for-teams-administrators" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In this next set of tasks, again, you may have to work with the administrators for your <em>Microsoft 365</em> tenancy or designated Teams administrator to approve and publish the Teams application. Access the Teams admin console <a href="https://admin.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Navigate to <em>Teams apps</em> &gt; <em>Manage apps</em>. The first thing you might notice is that there is an app that has been submitted and pending approval. In the table below, search and locate the application you have created.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Search for the Teams app." src="/assets/images/teams-admin-manage-apps-ae449a9cf3398cc0b6e275dd03aad8e4.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Click on the app, and on the app's details page, click <em>Publish</em> to approve the application for use in Teams.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Approve and publish the application." src="/assets/images/teams-admin-publish-app-f9175381ea28d34f25b819841f9e6bb6.png" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It takes a little while for the app to show up in Teams for it to appear in the Teams <em>Apps</em> store under <em>Built for your org</em> category and then add it to team. A quick workaround is to add it to the team immediately using the admin console as show in the figure below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Add the app to a team." src="/assets/images/teams-admin-add-app-to-team-8fe9547c5239cb9b313a162abe24171e.png" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the table of apps, select the application and then click the button <em>Add to team</em>.

They are for when I attempted to:</p><ul><li>Send a message when the Teams app was not published successfully.</li><li>Send a message when the Teams app was not added to the channel's team.</li><li>Send data to a channel other than the team's <em>General</em> channel.</li></ul><p>It appears this error is returned whenever there is an error making a REST call to the <em>Microsoft Graph</em> API.</p><p>The first two scenarios were easily resolved. However, I am still unable to send data to a channel, other than the team's <em>General</em> channel.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ora-20000-cant-access-team-check-app-has-enough-permission">ORA-20000: Cant Access Team, Check App has enough permission<a class="hash-link" href="#ora-20000-cant-access-team-check-app-has-enough-permission" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This one baffled me for a long time when I was trying to send data. In the documentation, it was stated that the value for <code>team</code> should be the <code>teamID</code> component in the team's link. However, the example code showed a value that looks a lot more like the <code>groupid</code>. As it turns out, this isn't a <em>permissions</em> issue, but rather, I had supplied the wrong value for <code>team</code>, and thus the internal ID for the team could not be found when the <em>Microsoft Bot</em> API was queried.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ora-20000-cant-access-channel-check-app-has-enough-permission">ORA-20000: Cant Access Channel, Check App has enough permission<a class="hash-link" href="#ora-20000-cant-access-channel-check-app-has-enough-permission" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Similar to the previous error message, you might get this error when an incorrect <code>channel</code> identifier is provided.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are countless use cases where developers might want to send notifications or data to users, whether it is through emails or a collaboration platform like Slack and Microsoft Teams. For example, notifying users involved in a business workflow for follow up action, sending daily reports to the C-suites, and more. Again, in Oracle APEX, we already have these capabilities by using either <code>APEX_MAIL</code> to send emails, or <code>APEX_WEB_SERVICE</code> to call webhooks and REST APIs. However, when working in an ADB, this provides yet another convenience method to perform the same task.</p><p>With regards to sending messages, I had wondered about why the development team might have chosen to implement the messaging using a bot as oppose to the simpler webhook interface. I found this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> that listed this as a comparison between the two approaches:</p><blockquote><p>A notification bot works as a Teams application. You can define your business logic to process data and show data in a customized format.</p></blockquote><p>With the added ability to generate and send data files, I can see why they opted to choose to implement the functionality using a bot. Further, wearing an "admin" hat, I would be more comfortable having a streamlined process for managing access to Teams and the associated resources in Microsoft 365 tenancy.</p><p>The team behind the Oracle Autonomous Database product is constantly working on new features to enhance the user/developer experience, and this is one of them! We can only hope that these "dbms_cloud"-type packages find their way quickly to the <em>Oracle Base Database</em> service and on-premise installations.</p><p>I hope this article helps you to use this new feature and skip the few pain points that I had experienced getting it going!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A cassette tape." src="/assets/images/cassette-tape_1280x720-5a94f95a05b6a01de9095f05ecd33401.png" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When I was first introduced to generative adversarial networks (GANs), I was impressed, but yet not impressed. The concept, performance, and outcomes of these advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms were truly jaw-dropping, but easily abused. And so, when everyone was excitedly chatting about <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>, I was cynical and tried to tune out until I came across a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sausheong_teachers-v-chatgpt-schools-face-new-challenge-activity-7015524158113533952-OClM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> by an old acquaintance, following a news article on concerns about ChatGPT and potential plagiarism in school.</p><blockquote><p><em>It's like someone using a calculator in an arithmetic exam, ChatGPT is just another tool.</em></p><p>-- <a href="https://sausheong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sau Sheong Chang</a></p></blockquote><p>That statement got me rethinking my stance on the technology, and curious about its utility in my day-to-day job.</p><p>And I'm glad I did. My own exploration of this subject started by reading Sau Sheong's <a href="https://medium.com/sausheong/chatting-about-chatgpt-645783b72e6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> to get a general idea about ChatGPT and the underlying technology that drives its ability to generate text and images. After <em>intelligent agents</em> and <em>artificial neural Networks</em>, <em>natural language processing</em> (NLP) was the next machine learning (ML) topic that I was passionate about. There wasn't a full module on that subject back when I was doing my graduate school training in <em>knowledge engineering</em> techniques, so it was pretty much a touch and go. Though during the pandemic, in 2020, I did take up a <em>Coursera</em>/<em>DeepLearning.AI</em> course on <em>Tensorflow</em> that covered NLP in one of its modules. There I got my legs deeper in the water and learned more in-depth about <em>recurrent neural networks</em> (RNN), <em>long short-term memory</em> (LSTM), and <em>Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers</em> (BERT). And the keyword <em>transformers</em> is what's driving algorithms such as the <em>Generative Pre-trained Transformer</em> (GPT) used by ChatGPT.</p><p><em>Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that are particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. They allow a model to effectively process input sequences of variable length and attend to certain parts of the input while generating output. In other words, they enable the model to understand the context and meaning of words and sentences. This is achieved by using self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions. This has led to significant improvements in the performance of models on a wide range of NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. Overall, the transformer architecture has been a major step forward in the field of NLP, and has been widely adopted in state-of-the-art models.</em></p><p>I don't know enough yet to go any deeper than flashing our buzzwords, and a lot of this is still over my head. I found this video to be very clear and easy to understand these concepts quickly, so have a watch!</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="writing-content-and-code">Writing Content and Code<a class="hash-link" href="#writing-content-and-code" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When I first started on this blog post, I thought about using OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DALL-E</em></a> model to generate an image that I could use in the banner. Unlike models such as <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>StyleGAN</em></a>, DALL-E is a a transformer language model that uses text and images as inputs to infer and generate a new image based on text inputs.</p><p>Here's what I did:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up for a free account to access OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank"

These models are designed to effectively process input sequences of variable length and generate output by using self-attention mechanisms. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions, which is crucial for understanding the context and meaning of words and sentences. A key component of transformers is the use of positional encoding, which allows the model to understand the order of the words in a sentence, even when the input is processed in parallel. This was a new concept and meaning to the word "Attention" when it was first introduced in NLP.</p><p>There are many use cases for transformers in NLP, including but not limited to machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and text-to-speech synthesis. The transformer architecture has been widely adopted in state-of-the-art models and has led to significant improvements in performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.</p></blockquote><p>I don't know if I could express it as well as it did, but hey, I like it. But do I like using it? Not really. I'm still not fully comfortable with using the text as-is. I like my content to be authentically "me" with my language flaws included. However, how is this different from engaging a professional copywriter to write an article based on the ideas you provide?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-owns-the-content">Who Owns the Content<a class="hash-link" href="#who-owns-the-content" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I think this is a question that is often ask and debated upon. Who owns the generated code, images, or text? For DALL-E, their <a href="https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content policy</a> and <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6468065-dall-e-content-policy-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> seems to say that you are free to use the generated images, however, my immediate concern was about the work that it was derived upon. That appears to be explained <a href="https://github.com/openai/DALL-E/blob/master/model_card.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm not good with legalese, and so, my level of comfort using the images generated is 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. And I'd presume that the concerns about generated code and text are very similar.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-caniuse-in-oracle-apex">The "CANIUSE" in Oracle APEX<a class="hash-link" href="#the-caniuse-in-oracle-apex" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Yes! For those new to <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a>, this is a rapid application development platform that lets you create usable web applications very quickly.

As to "text-to-speech", it does not appear to be in the list of APIs that OpenAI has, so I wonder where that suggestion came from. Perhaps ChatGPT is pulling a fast one?</p><p>So, I thought I'd ask ChatGPT the same question that I'm trying to answer:</p><div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">How does Oracle AI compare with ChatGPT?</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>And this is what it said:</p><blockquote><p>Oracle AI and ChatGPT are both natural language processing (NLP) technologies, but they have different capabilities and are used for different purposes.</p><p>ChatGPT is a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI. It is primarily used for generating human-like text, such as in chatbots, virtual assistants, and language generation tasks. ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of text, allowing it to generate text that is often indistinguishable from human-written text.</p><p>Oracle AI, on the other hand, is a collection of AI-based products and services offered by Oracle Corporation. It includes several NLP-based technologies, such as natural language understanding, text analytics, and chatbot building. Oracle AI is designed to be used in enterprise environments and can be integrated with other Oracle products and services.</p><p>In summary, ChatGPT is more focused on language generation, while Oracle AI is a broader set of AI-based products and services that can include NLP capabilities. Oracle AI is more focused on enterprise and business use cases, while ChatGPT is focused more on generating human-like text.</p></blockquote><p>Apart from the first paragraph, I'd say that's mostly factual and accurate. Hence, I can only conclude that it's a rather difficult comparison to make. Duh! My main goal here was really to highlight how we could also use Oracle AI to provide solutions for some of these use cases.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Cool as this technology might be, there's a nagging fear that pretty soon, IT practitioners, like myself, would be replaced by AI. I think that fear is valid. However, as Sau Sheong aptly describes ChatGPT, these are tools and we should embrace and empower ourselves to do our jobs faster and better. It was only a few years ago when Oracle launched the Autonomous Database product. Back <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2018/12/19/2018-the-year-the-database-went-autonomous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then</a>, it was touted to be intelligent and sent shivers down the DBAs' spine. After almost four years, DBAs are still needed even when a company's running only ADBs in their environment. What it has done was take away some of the mundane tasks like database patching and upgrading (an introduced new ones) as advertised. Freeing us up to perform other functions, be innovative, and allowed us to discover other efficiencies and approaches to improve business operations.</p><p>I have used ChatGPT in the past few days to help me in certain tasks such as writing a French version of an email, and constructing some of parts of this blog post. I still had to validate and adapt the outputs, but more importantly, like in the case of writing this blog post, compose the flow and piece them altogether for the final content. I don't think ChatGPT is quite ready to replicate my thought processes, feelings/opinions, and validate the story I wished to tell.</p><p>And my last words are to thank the brilliant brains at OpenAI, Google, and all over the world for their contributions to computer science so that I can write this blog post with a bit more flavour. But please try not to make Judgement Day a reality. Thank you!</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@lunarts?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/D5_cfqMAY0Y?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of them came from countries as far as Singapore. While up in the North, the <em>Aurora Borealis</em> might be a common sight, for tourists, it is still pretty much a calculated risk that it might be a fruitless journey. The night skies were overcast on the first night that they arrived, and it was bitterly cold for folks used to tropical weather, but they persisted. On their second night, there was a minor emergency that delayed a few of them from heading out to the remote site for viewing the <em>Northern Lights</em>, but again, they were determined. Within minutes of their arrival at the viewing site, there was a sudden break in the cloudy skies that coincided with a display of greens and purples that illuminated in the heavens. What a treat!</p><p>As we near the end of 2022, I'd like to reflect on the year's challenges and milestones.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="published-a-second-book">Published a Second Book<a class="hash-link" href="#published-a-second-book" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In 2021, I had started work and finished two chapters for a would be <em>Pro Oracle Application Express</em> along with a few other community members. However, that book never materialized and was cancelled by the publisher. Not willing to throw away the work that I had done, I did the unthinkable of asking the publisher if I could complete a book under a very different title. One that would cover different <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</em></a> (OCI) services that could be used in an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Application Express</em></a> (APEX) application.</p><p>Midway through the book, I was told that the esteemed <a href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/helihelskyaho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heli Helskyaho</a> would be the book's technical reviewer. And since I had some chapters on integrating APEX with OCI AI Service and Machine Learning planned, I figured, why not ask if she would be more interested on being a co-author instead. That was the best decision ever! Heli's a great person to work with. She's dedicated, hardworking, and always optimistic. I don't think I would have been able to complete the book on time had she not gotten involved.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Book Cover" src="/assets/images/978-1-4842-8170-3-094ac9f31d9ecd1bdbca443782c18185.jpg" width="827" height="1180" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We published the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8170-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Extending Oracle Application Express with Oracle Cloud Features</em></a> in September 2022. Book projects are very demanding, and more often than not, would fail without strong external support. I am first of all very grateful to Heli for sharing this burden with me. I also want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gennick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Gennick</a>, who has since moved from Apress to Manning. Jonathan's a great editor to work with and very experienced. He's been a great guide for both the books I published through Apress, and will miss working with him.</p><p>Anyone who actively writes on the OCI without company support, and <strong>was</strong> not an <a href="https://ace.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle ACE</a> Director, would know that it is tough justifying the monetary costs of experimenting with its services. Fortunately for us, we had some support through <a href="https://linktr.ee/iaasgeek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guillermo Ruiz</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boenglish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bo English-Wiczling</a>. Not just with resources, but the access to Oracle Product Managers and early access to OCI Services. Thank you "G" and Bo.</p><p>Finally, much thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-cannell-thtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen Cannell</a> for replacing Heli as the book's technical reviewer. Thanks for taking time to read through all our chapters thoroughly, and offering many value advices and suggestion to improve the quality of the publication.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="travels-and-conferences">Travels and Conferences<a class="hash-link" href="#travels-and-conferences" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It was stressful, but refreshing, to be travelling to conferences again.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/oraclebase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Hall</a>, I am writing again, after a long pause, to celebrate <a href="https://oracle-base.com/blog/2022/09/27/joel-kallman-day-2022-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Kallman Day 2022</a>. My contribution today is about my deep appreciation for the team behind the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a> (OCI) <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Services</a>. Below is a quick scoop on how I have used these services to improve on my <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/tutorials/learning-languages-with-oracle-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCI-powered e-flashcard</a> for learning new words in a different language. I will be doing a quick demonstration (session LRN3673) of this work at the upcoming <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle CloudWorld 2022</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-e-flashcard-solution">The E-Flashcard Solution<a class="hash-link" href="#the-e-flashcard-solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A <strong>TL;DR</strong> for my initial article on the e-flashcard solution.</p><p>On my fridge, I have a <a href="https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-controllers/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-v1-1-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M5Paper</a> that pulls a random English word or phrase from an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a>. The word/phrase and the Japanese translation are entered using an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) and exposed as a REST service using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services</a>. The translation task was performed manually using a tool like <a href="https://translate.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Translate</a>.</p><p>Then <a href="https://twitter.com/dgielis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimitri Gielis</a> made this suggestion:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Source: https://twitter.com/dgielis/status/1358781075879845888" src="/assets/images/dgielis-tweet-e572365163a8c8516a86a0c0ef05b7a4.png" width="1188" height="416" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The second version of my implementation isn't quite driven by <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Alexa</a> yet, but at least for the web interface, I had added a voice input functionality that allowed me to speak a word and translate it to a language of my choosing.</p><blockquote><p>Voice =&gt; APEX =&gt; Speech Service =&gt; Language Service =&gt; DB =&gt; ORDS =&gt; M5Paper</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speech-service">Speech Service<a class="hash-link" href="#speech-service" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Released in early 2022, the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/speech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speech Service</a> is one of several OCI's AI Services that uses Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to transcribe audio content to text. Initially, the service was very limited in what audio formats it received, specifically, it had to be single channel at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz, encoded in <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCM</a>, and saved in the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAV</a> format.</p><p>The strict requirements made it difficult to implement using a purely web-based interface. One would have to capture the audio using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Recorder API</a> and any of its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/codecs_parameter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported codecs</a>, transcode it using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FFmpeg</a>, executed using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Functions</a>, and then submitted a Speech transcription job.</p><p>I then looked at other solutions that used Web Assembly to perform the audio format purely in the browser, such as <a href="https://kbumsik.io/opus-media-recorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opus MediaRecorder</a> and <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FFMPEG.WASM</a>. Unfortunately, I ran out of time, got busy, and had to put this project on hold.</p><p>Thankfully, months later, a newer version of the service was <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/oci-speech-now-supports-seven-new-languages-and-additional-input-formats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a>. Apart from the new languages supported, it also allowed users to submit audio files in a other formats, several of which are supported by the Media Recorder API. Hurrah!</p><p>I kept most of the initial prototype and updated the <em>Ajax Callback</em>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Recording audio through an APEX modal page." src="/assets/images/audio-record-ui-6b68311c224e247da0d136dbcbb93df2.png" width="2560" height="1920" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I will avoid making this post unreadable by not listing the source code of the PL/SQL procedure I wrote, but here's the pseudocode:</p><ol><li>Upload the recorded audio as a BLOB and store it in OCI <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Object Storage</a>.</li><li>Create a transcription job.</li><li>If successful, query the transcription job using the job's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCID</a>.</li><li>Loop until the job state is either <code>SUCCEEDED</code>, <code>FAILED</code>, or <code>CANCELED</code>.</li><li>If the state is <code>SUCCEEDED</code>, then get the transcription job's task and get the location of the results stored as an object in the Object Storage.</li><li>Retrieve the transcription results stored as JSON.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="language-service-v2">Language Service "V2"<a class="hash-link" href="#language-service-v2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In Chapter 4 of the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8170-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Extending Oracle Application Express with Oracle Cloud Features "</a>, I describe how you can host and use a language translation service using a few OCI resources and an open sourced engine like <a href="https://libretranslate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreTranslate</a>. Before getting limited access to the next generation of Language Service, my solution looked like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Initial approach to language translation." src="/assets/images/translation-past-063b92d88c5945f71bf3a93a5a2e56db.png" width="2320" height="496" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Since then, I have abandoned all of that for a simplified solution using the Language pre-trained models for text translation. As there is limited availability, so is the documentation. Fortunately, the service also comes with an OCI Console-based user interface to try out the service. With that, I was able to figure out what I needed to call the service in the APEX application through REST. Believe me, it's not difficult.</p><p>To the amazing people behind these products.

The Shirelles.</p></blockquote><p>As a technologist, we are constantly bombarded with buzzwords and terms like blockchain, IoT, AI, machine learning, quantum computing, and so much more! I love buzzwords, and wholeheartedly enjoy deciphering the future of technology and work. Hence, for the last few years, I have been a proud member of the committee that peruses and selects abstracts for the Kscope Emerging Technology (ET) track. For next year's <a href="https://kscope22.odtug.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kscope22</a>, I am honoured to be leading the team that will help select a series of sessions that are visionary, and hopefully, give us guidance on what to expect in the years ahead.</p><p>For the last few Kscopes, ET sessions generally fell under this selection criteria:</p><ol><li>About the following subject(s):<ul><li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Internet of Things (IoT)</li><li>Serverless Computing</li><li>Chatbots</li></ul></li><li>Involve Oracle technology</li></ol><p>Today, many of these exciting technologies have gone mainstream, and so, we have decided to give the ET track a facelift. For next year's conference, we have decided to focus on new subject areas. They are:</p><ul><li>AI Engineering</li><li>AIOps</li><li>Digital Twins</li><li>Distributed Cloud</li><li>General Advancements in Technology</li><li>Hyperautomation</li><li>Internet of Behaviours</li><li>Next-Generate Security</li><li>Quantum Computing</li><li>Sustainability</li><li>Total Experience</li></ul><p>You can find this list and a brief description of each theme <a href="https://kscope22.odtug.com/page/kscope22-tracks#emergingtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>I should also emphasize that the use of Oracle technology is <strong>NOT</strong> required. Sure it would be nice that it does, but it is important that we look beyond our comfort zones. If you are not an Oracle professional but have something novel to share, then I strongly encourage you to submit an abstract. This is also a great opportunity for researchers, post-docs, and post-graduate students to share your research. Getting a talk accepted means a <em>FREE</em> ticket (air tickets and <a href="https://kscope22.odtug.com/page/kscope22-location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luxurious accommodation</a> are not included) to attend one of the top tech conferences in the world. And for those of you who are, go through your address books and LinkedIn connections lists, and spread the word. Invite a luminary to join us in Texas next year! Or, if you prefer, you may send <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzziebrain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">me</a> suggestions <em>via</em> Twitter.</p><p>Stay healthy and enjoy this rendition of the song <em>Will You Love Me Tomorrow</em> by one of my favourite songwriters, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carole King</a>.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><blockquote><u>Photo Credits</u><p>This post's banner photo is by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@drew_beamer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Beamer</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/future?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a>.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

Joel was a wonderful man who was not only passionate about his work, but was even more devoted to uplifting others.

With new features recently introduced in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/data-science/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Machine Learning</a> product offering, it is now relatively easy to introduce ML as a component of your <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) applications. This is the first of several posts that I am writing as a follow up to the presentations I did at this year's (virtual) conference.</p><p>The whys and how we created our first Machine Learning (ML) model using <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/machinelearning/introducing-oml-automl-user-interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML UI</a> is detailed in our presentation, so I highly encourage you to review the presentation to get the required background information. There are also several tutorials that Oracle has published to help you get going with the technology. In this blog post, the goal is to provide details on code needed to consume the ML model that we operationalised using OML Services. these are:</p><ul><li><a href="#Authentication">How to authenticate with the REST services</a></li><li><a href="#Inputs-and-Outputs">Identifying the REST service's inputs and outputs</a>; and finally</li><li><a href="#using-the-Deployed-Model">Using the Deployed Model</a></li></ul><p>Also, it would be worthwhile pointing out that AutoML, OML Services, and many of the other Oracle technologies described in this post are only available on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a> (ADB) at this time, including the two <em>Always Free</em> instances that you get with every Oracle Cloud account.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="authentication">Authentication<a class="hash-link" href="#authentication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To secure OML Service endpoints, clients must use an OML Service account and obtain an <em>access token</em>.

Once you are satisfied with the predicted model, you can then deploy the model thus exposing it through OML Services as a REST endpoint. To consume the REST service, there are three essential information that we will require:</p><ol><li>The REST endpoint URL.</li><li>The request's input parameters and how to transmit them.</li><li>The response's expected output format.</li></ol><p>You can access this information from the metadata published after the models are deployed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="List of Deployed ML Models" src="/assets/images/inputs-and-outputs-afbad3af210a9e1bb7cf6084dd15f22e.png" width="1280" height="389" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The endpoint URL can be derived from the <em>Open API Specification</em> for the service that you can access by clicking the link labelled "A".

            <description><![CDATA[Embedded ARM chip]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Embedded ARM chip" src="/assets/images/arm-chip_1200x720-f0b95bb9172f7f1029520abf5762013b.jpg" width="1200" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In September 2020, Oracle first <a href="https://youtu.be/aVwLlkhERuQ?t=331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that it was working with <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ampere Computing</a> to provide ARM-based chips for its Compute instance offering on the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>. They have delivered!</p><p>ARM chips are found in many low-powered devices like smartphones, single-board computers, and IoT devices. So, if you are an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) developer, you might be wondering, "What's in it for me?" Well, remember we <a href="/content/id/2004">talked</a> about running a customer-managed <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services</a> (ORDS) instance for an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a>?</p><p>The OCI isn't the first platform to offer ARM-based compute resources. You will find a similar offering from AWS with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graviton</a> processors. Instead of custom-designing a processor, Oracle opted to use the <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/altra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ampere Altra Processor</a> that has 80 cores running at a maximum frequency of 3.3 Ghz. Check out AnandTech's <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> of the chip.</p><p>If you are interested to read about the performance comparisons between the ARM and x86 architectures, please check out this <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/arm-vs-x86-cloud-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>. What I understand is that for hosting web applications that are typically single threaded, ARM chips offer a better cost-to-performance ratio, not to mention, lower power consumption. Each processing core is also generally cheaper than its competitors, thus allowing cloud vendors to provision them at cheaper rates. We saw this happening when Oracle first launched the AMD EPYC-based compute shapes that were cheaper than Intel's at that time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-get-started">Let's Get Started<a class="hash-link" href="#lets-get-started" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As with other processor types, OCI customers can opt to provision virtual machines or bare metal machines:</p><ul><li><strong>VM.Standard.A1.Flex.</strong> Like the AMD EPYC Flex shapes, users can create instances with a flexible number of OCPUs and memory. Servers can be provisioned with 1 to 80 OCPUs, and 1 to 512 GB memory.</li><li><strong>BM.Standard.A1.160.</strong> Only one shape for bare metal machines is available at this time. It comes with 160 OCPUs and 1 TB of memory.</li></ul><p>Oracle has also provided a generous Oracle Cloud Free Tier allotment of Ampere compute instance. Users can provision an <em>Always Free</em> compute instance with up to 4 OCPUs and 24 GB of memory (see the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-unlocks-power-of-arm-processors-at-one-cent-per-core-hour-2021-05-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>). The Always Free block volume allotment has also increased from 100 to 200 GB. Yes, there are no charges and no end dates for these resources. I will use this to host the customer-managed ORDS instance. Beyond that, according to the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cost-estimator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost estimator</a>, each additional OCPU will cost you only $10 per month, and $1 for every gigabyte of memory!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note.</strong> These A1 cores are single-threaded. In x86-based shapes, 1 OCPU has 2 virtual CPUs.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create an Ampere-shaped Compute instance." src="/assets/images/create-compute-instance-c60a56de44cd2076759bc46d14de00b8.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The downside of moving to an ARM chip is the availability of software support. For example, though you can install the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Instant Client</a> on an ARM system, Oracle has not released AArch64 database binaries. Fortunately for us, there already exists a Java port for this architecture, so there should be no issues deploying ORDS or running it standalone. However, at the time of writing, the ORDS package is not available to install through the Oracle Yum repositories. I will instead deploy ORDS on a <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomcat</a> server using <a href="https://podman.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podman</a>. The official <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> image that I will use can be found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Take note that you will have to ensure that you deploy a version of ORDS that's compatible to what the ADB is using.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Use Database Actions to check version of ORDS that the ADB is running." src="/assets/images/checking-ords-version-29ad0477fdddc912bcfccd3e42853cad.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After provisioning the Oracle Enterprise Linux 8 server, login as the user <em>opc</em> and install the following software:</p><ul><li>OCI Command Line Interface (CLI)</li><li>Podman</li><li>[Optional]<!-- --> Support for emulating Docker CLI using podman</li></ul><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">sudo</span><span class="token plain"> dnf </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><span class="token plain"> python36-oci-cli </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">podman</span><span class="token plain"> podman-docker</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Create the base directory where we will deploy our files to.</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token assign-left variable" style="color:#36acaa">BASE_PATH</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain">/opt/podman/ords </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">\</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">mkdir</span><span class="token plain"> -p </span><span class="token variable" style="color:#36acaa">$BASE_PATH</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Stage the following installer files in the directory <code>$BASE_PATH/files</code>:</p><ul><li><code>apex_20.2.zip</code></li><li><code>p32006852_2020_Generic.zip</code></li><li><code>ords-21.1.1.116.2032.zip</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> At the time of writing, the ADB is still running APEX 20.2 with the latest Patch Set Bundle.

However, as much as I love it, I have long griped about the lack of out-of-the-box support for AI services that many of Oracle's competitors have. Well, as of May 6, 2021, I am glad to see that things are starting to turn around with the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/releasenotes/changes/f801b1f5-b40d-49a5-bbb1-e2b2001ce2cf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch</a> of the OCI <em>Language</em> service.</p><p>Today, there are different ways to "AI-enable" an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Application Express</em></a> (APEX). For a long time now, Oracle has had several PL/SQL packages under the Oracle Enterprise Database's Machine Learning option, or what used to be known as Oracle Advanced Analytics. This option is in fact, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/database/machine-learning,-spatial-and-graph-no-license-required-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer</a> an option and is included in all editions of the database.</p><p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/datawarehouse-bigdata/oml4sql.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Oracle Machine Learning for SQL</em></a> (OML4SQL) allows the PL/SQL developer to train and apply ML models without the data leaving the database. It supports a variety of ML algorithms, and generally, does not require developers to have advanced theoretical knowledge of ML. And because it relies only on PL/SQL and SQL, it can be easily integrated into APEX. However, developers are limited to ML algorithms that have been implemented by Oracle.</p><p>About a month ago, Oracle announced the general availability of <em>AutoML</em> and <em>OML Services</em> on the <em>Autonomous Database</em> (ADB). Developers who are not too ML-savvy can use the AutoML UI (user interface), available through the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks that is included with every ADB. AutoMl automates the process of selecting, training, testing, and evaluating ML models. The generated models can then be exposed through OML Services' REST APIs.</p><p>However, sometimes, all we need is a ready-to-use AI/ML model that performs a rather generic task. Very common these days is the need to perform <em>Sentiment Analysis</em> on a body of text. Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services has Text Analytics and AWS has Amazon Comprehend. What does Oracle have? At least now we can say, "OCI Language Services." It took a while, but better late than never!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="identity-and-policy">Identity and Policy<a class="hash-link" href="#identity-and-policy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As a best practice, we should create an OCI user specifically for interacting with the OCI REST API on behalf of the APEX application. The user should have limited OCI capabilities and should only be allowed to have API access and nothing more. You will need to generate the API keys and can easily do this from the user's details page in the OCI console.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Generate and download the API key pair from OCI console." src="/assets/images/generate-download-api-keys-96cc67d2152726a764c819f68d2dc552.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You should also download the keys in PEM format. Also, gather the information (click the <em>View Configuration File</em> link on the user's details page) that you will need to setup the APEX Web Credentials for OCI, specifically:</p><ul><li>User OCID</li><li>Tenant OCID; and</li><li>The API key's fingerprint</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Gather the OCI information that you will need." src="/assets/images/gather-information-87f5622a950a8956edf13604e40aae48.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Open the private key that you had downloaded from the OCI console and remove (a) the enclosing tags <code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----</code> and <code>-----END PRIVATE KEY-----</code>; and (b) <strong>all</strong> newline characters. The end result should be a very long string of characters. This is the <em>OCI Private Key</em> that you will need to provide in the APEX Web Credentials. Copy the text, but <strong>do not</strong> save the PEM file.</p><p>Create the Web Credentials with the required information about your user and tenancy.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Setup APEX Web Credentials." src="/assets/images/web-credentials-71cc4c78df4dc7ce1cd8059658f14425.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Next, create an IAM Group, e.g., <em>AiLanguageUsers</em>, and assign the user to the group.</p><p>To use the Language Services, we will need to create a policy to allow users access.

Today, I found out with a lot of excitement, that one of my slides was now factually wrong!</p><p>For a while now, Oracle has provided SDKs (Software Development Kits) for a wide range of programming languages, but strangely, that didn't include PL/SQL. Thankfuly, the wait and bewilderment is now finally over! Well, at least for folks who are running their applications on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a> (ADB). And yes, even if you're on an <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Always Free</em></a> instance.</p><p>Don't believe me? Use your favourite database client and login to your ADB instance using the <em>admin</em> account.

However, not every endpoint worked out-of-the-box and I have found problems accessing some endpoints. We also had to write our own code for constructing the request payload and parsing the responses.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Getting Started with Oracle Cloud Free Tier Book Cover" src="/assets/images/9781484260104-book-cover-7cbf8c075405ca08df1fe96b16c58f5e.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I won't deny that it has been a challenging and tough journey, but today, I'm glad to be able to declare that the book "<a href="https://www.apress.com/book/9781484260104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started with Oracle Cloud Free Tier</a>" has been published and available to purchase!</p><p>How time flies!</p><p>Looking back, it's been almost a year since <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanGennick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Gennick</a> at <a href="https://apress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apress</a> first approached me to see if I was keen to write a book on the then recently-announced <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Free Tier</a>. I was excited about what Oracle was doing with this new offering, and even more eager to share what I knew about the Oracle Cloud, so I quickly said, "Yes!"</p><p>There was a lot of ground to cover and we had aimed to publish the book ahead of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/openworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle OpenWorld</a> (OOW) 2020. Fortunately, I was able to rope in <a href="https://twitter.com/lucdemanche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luc Demanche</a> as a co-author. Luc focused on the infrastucture-related topics, while I tackled areas closer to my heart, software applications, including the longest chapter written for readers who are totally new to <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a>. It was tough compressing as much information as I could about such a great platform in only one chapter.</p><p>It was also particularly daunting to venture into other web application development platforms like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask</a> for Python developers, and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> for JavaScript developers. I wanted to demonstrate that the Oracle Cloud wasn't just for the APEX geeks. There's something for everyone!</p><p>More than just being knowledgeable about the Oracle Cloud, Luc was also a seasoned author. This is his second book, and his experience and cheer-leading helped contribute greatly to the successful completion of this new adventure. I am greatly indebted to him. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Jonathon again for the opportunity, and to his team of editors and project managers, who helped guide us along the editorial process. And last but not least, a special thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/CRuepprich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christoph Ruepprich</a>, who sacrificed his time to help ensure that what we wrote was technically sound.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oracle-groundbreakers-apac-virtual-tour-2020">Oracle Groundbreakers APAC Virtual Tour 2020<a class="hash-link" href="#oracle-groundbreakers-apac-virtual-tour-2020" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In other news, I'm honoured and glad to be participating in the upcoming <a href="https://www.apacgbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Groundbreakers APAC Virtual Tour</a> happening next month, October 2020. I will be presenting my session "Store Your Treasures in the Cloud", that will provide a detailed walkthrough on integrating Oracle Cloud <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Object Storage</a> with APEX application. And yes, you can certainly do this with <em>Always Free</em>-only resources.</p><p>Born and bred in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a>, there's a warm fuzzy feeling knowing that I'll be speaking in a region closer to home. Especially so this year with COVID-19 disrupting my travel plans. As one of my favourite singers <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dawa_Dolma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">阿兰</a> would say, "无论我们飞得有多高，有多远，永远不要忘记自己的家乡，不要忘记自己的梗。"</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Keep Security Up to Date" src="/assets/images/house-keys-4516178_1280-383c03a67d84f3db77f78343070fe841.jpg" width="2560" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In my previous blog post on <a href="/content/id/2005">Running ORDS Against the Autonomous Database - Part 2</a>, we had looked at how to add an existing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Encrypt</a> (LE) SSL certificate to an <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a> (OCI) Load Balancer. You'd typically wwant to host your websites or <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> applications over a secure transport layer, especially when sensitive data is communicated between the browser and server.</p><p>Typically, I'd run scripts on the web server to generate and renew certificates using <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certbot</a>, since it would be easy enough to point the web server configuration to use the generated artifacts, as well as to perform service restarts. However, with the load balancer, this becomes more challenging. It doesn't help that LE certificates expire every 90 days.</p><p>I've found it most reliable to run certbot from within a <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> to avoid any dependency issues and you can quite easily get the published image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Hub</a> including some with plugins to work directly with DNS services like <a href="https://cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>. These are important if you wanted to obtain wildcard certificates that requires a different challenge process.</p><p>Once the certificates have been generated, they would have to be deployed to the OCI load balancer and assigned to the active listener that supports HTTPS requests. You could do this manually through the OCI console, but it is a mundane and routine task that is prone to neglect, so I had to figure out a way to automate this part of the process.</p><p>On the web server, Certbot is usually called by a cron job once a day. It checks if a certificate is expiring and will initiate the renewal process if it is. It also has hooks that allow you to execute external scripts. For example, after a certificate is successfully generated or renewed, a <em>post-hook</em> could be used to restart a web server.</p><p>Using the Certbot hooks and the <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCI CLI</a>, I created a Docker image that encapsulates both pieces of software, and then have them work together to perform both tasks in concert. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/oci-le-cert-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The documentation is a little rough and lengthy, so I will leave you to read the steps described in the <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/oci-le-cert-manager/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a> file.</p><p>Hope this helps you maintain and secure your web applications!</p><blockquote><u>Photo Credits</u><p>Photo by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/Schluesseldienst-13794927/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schluesseldienst</a>

With the release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services</a> (ORDS) version 19.4.6, many of us were eager to deploy a customer-managed ORDS solution in order to support vanity URLs with <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX), myself <a href="/content/id/2004">included</a>. It has worked well for me until a few days ago, I noticed that my <a href="https://oracle.com/jet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle JET</a> charts weren't loading any more.</p><p>A quick check showed multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP 404</a> errors were triggered. APEX was referencing a newer Oracle JET version, 8.3.0 insted of the stock 8.0.0.</p><p>One of the key benefits of running APEX on an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-autonomous-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a> is auto-patching, and clearly something got updated in the recent days. True enough, an updated Patch Set Bundle (PSE) was released on July 20, 2020 (Source: <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://apex.oracle.com/download</a>).</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/apex-downloads/apex-201-known-issues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Known Issues</a> page, it states:</p><blockquote><p>With 20.1, we integrated the following third party libraries: Oracle JET 8.0.0, jQuery 3.4.1, jQuery Migrate 3.0.1, and jQuery FullCalendar 3.10.0. Upgraded versions of these libraries have been made available: Oracle JET 8.3.0, jQuery 3.5.1, jQuery Migrate 3.3.0, and jQuery FullCalendar 3.10.2.</p></blockquote><p>Here's what I did to get my server updated.</p><ol><li>Login to <a href="https://support.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Support</a> and search <code>30990551</code>, or simply click <a href="https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/PatchDetail?patchId=30990551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li><li>Download the patch.

Like APEX, ORDS is also included as a feature of the ADB. However, there are certain situations where you might like to manage your own instance of ORDS.</p><p>Three key reasons stand out for me:</p><ol><li>Using my own domain for my APEX applications.</li><li>Managing the number of database connections consumed by ORDS for my Always Free ADB that comes with a limit of 20 concurrent database sessions.</li><li>Restricting "direct" access to the ADB, for example, to connect to the database using external tools like <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sqldeveloper-landing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL Developer and SQLcl</a>.</li></ol><p>The figure below depicts the topology that I will build for my APEX applications.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Planned topology" src="/assets/images/topology-6d1358e72c4a6f2bac7a83a107bdc6d7.png" width="705" height="335" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Note that I chose a single subnet for the Load Balancer and Compute.

It has a special bandwidth size called <em>Micro</em> and is limited to a maximum of 10 Mbps.</p><p>Go to the Load Balancers page. You will find it under the Networks menu item. Click on the blue <em>Create Load Balancer</em> button to begin.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create Load Balancer Wizard" src="/assets/images/screen01-f41fbb5770ab6122bbac193dd1b2ca64.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the first step, do the following:</p><ul><li>Provide a suitable name.</li><li>Set the visibility type to <em>Public</em>.</li><li>Set the total bandwidth to <em>Micro</em>. Note that this size is not selectable if you have already created one, or are not in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) home region.</li><li>Select the appropriate Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and subnet that the load balancer should be placed in. Make sure that it is setup as a public network, an Internet Gateway and network route rules for bidirectional Internet traffic.</li></ul><p>In the next step, leave the default settings. However, on the third and final step, change the listener to listen for HTTP traffic.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create Load Balancer Wizard - Final Step" src="/assets/images/screen02-8bf1a871ab58f23513bacfba2b287322.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Click on <em>Submit</em> to create the load balancer. A Listener and Backend Set is also created in the process, but we should delete them both once the load balancer is up.</p><p>Once created, the Load Balancer Details page will display the Reserved Public IP address it has been assigned with. Use this to update your DNS records.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Load Balancer Details page" src="/assets/images/screen03-95a594d6a286b314c38b53d631e5a65b.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>Remember to delete the listener and backend set created by default.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backend-sets">Backend Sets<a class="hash-link" href="#backend-sets" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Next, create the backend set that includes the Compute instance hosting ORDS. On the left side of the Load Balancer Details page, you will find a list of Resources that can be managed. Click on <em>Backend Sets</em> and then click on the blue <em>Create Backend Set</em> button to launch the wizard.</p><p>Provide a suitable name and then leave the default values for <em>Traffic Distribution Policy</em> and <em>Session Persistence</em>.

You can access the list of backends from the Resources menu on the left of the Backend Set Information page.</p><p>To begin, click the blue <em>Add Backends</em> button and then select the Compute instance that is hosting ORDS.

More often than not, you will have other requirements. For example, the <a href="https://apeks.app/sponsor-a-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APEX Challenge Coin</a> website uses a path alias that links to the APEX application for submitting nominations. In web servers, these are usually addressed by creating URL rewrite rules that redirect you to the correct address. For this purpose, you may use a <em>Rule Set</em> and assign it to a listener. Here's a full list of rule types that you can create:</p><ul><li>Access Control</li><li>Access Method</li><li>URL Redirect</li><li>Request Header</li><li>Response Header</li><li>HTTP Header</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Create Rule Set Modal Dialog" src="/assets/images/screen09-239f0cedc610e731f8e3bb7d2f1b7d9b.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You might also serve other resources hosted on other backend servers. For example, I host some static content on the apeks.app website. For that, I run an Apache Web Server that hosts a single static HTML page. I can create Path Route Sets that will redirect the browser to the appropriate backend server based on the supplied path. Any path that starts with <code>/i</code> or <code>/ords</code>, which is used by APEX and ORDS, hands off to the backend running ORDS. The default, and so every other path, will lead to the other web server.</p><blockquote><p><em>Update <!-- -->[Sep 14, 2020]</em></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_RgMBmO0DI7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Barton</a> for pointing out in the comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Man repairing the engine of a car" src="/assets/images/auto-repair-3691962_1280x720-ca2ffcc26a0bc90f55096abb4a9bf53e.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-autonomous-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Autonomous Database</a> (ADB) is Oracle's current flagship database product and rightly so! Each instance comes with self-tuning, self-patching and several Oracle Database Options that customer would otherwise have to purchase separate licenses for. Database developers will also be pleased to know that there are a suite of tools at your disposal including <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX), <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services</a> (ORDS) and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/datawarehouse-bigdata/oml-notebooks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks</a>.</p><p>The minimum instance you can create will have 1 CPU and 1 TB of storage and with so much features, doesn't come cheap. Here's the good news though, Oracle provides <strong>everyone</strong> two <em>Always Free</em> ADBs through the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Free Tier</a> offering. Yes, that's a great deal for anyone wanting to host a simple web application on the Internet. It is however, not without limits.</p><p>Unlike the paid Autonomous Database, a free instance is limited to 1 CPU with no autoscaling, 8 GB of RAM and 20 GB of storage. It will also be shutdown after 7 days of inactivity, and even terminated if left in that state for too long. Another important limitation is the 20 concurrent database session limit imposed on the instance. These are crucial considerations that you will need to take into account when running production applications on the free instance.</p><p>If you can run your applications successfully within these limits, then ADBs are a great choice for deploying APEX applications for several reasons. The most obvious benefit is that you do not have to be an expert database administrator (DBA) to install, tune and manage the database. These are all handled automatically by Oracle. Upgrading and patching the database and APEX are either performed incrementally in the background or in some cases, initiated by the user with a simple button click.</p><p>Typically, after installing APEX on the database, users will also have to install, configure and deploy ORDS. The software can either run in a standalone mode or deployed on a Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) container. For the ADB though, ORDS comes preinstalled on a separate, robust and scalable hardware infrastructure.</p><p>Not surprisingly, that convenience comes with some restrictions. When the ADB is provisioned, you are assigned a cryptic URL that Oracle assigns and till today (June 30, 2020), <em>vanity URLs</em> are still not supported. That means, you may not assign a domain name to your APEX instance, e.g. <a href="http://example.com/orcl/apex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://example.com/orcl/apex</a>.</p><p>While you can use a web server and appropriate proxy rules, mask the APEX instance, it does have inherent security risks. I have also found it challenging to get Social Sign-In (OAuth2) working with APEX applications because of how URLs used in the authentication workflow are generated.</p><p>Access to the database and its tools are managed together. It is my understanding that it is not possible to assign different access rules. For example, perhaps we want users to access the APEX instance from the web, but only connect to the database using SQL Developer while on the corporate network. That's not possible at least for now.</p><p>Thankfully, with the release of ORDS version 19.4.6, it is now possible to install your own instance of ORDS alongside the ADB. You can find the feature description <a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/ords/ords-relnotes-1946.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>BUG 30957867 - Implement feature to support alternative runtime user (ORDS_PUBLIC_USER)</p></blockquote><p>With a customer-managed ORDS, we can create different entry points to the ADB. This ORDS instance can be placed in an Internet-facing subnet, while access to the ADB can be limited to the new ORDS instance and restricted networks by either using an Access Control List (ACL), or in the case of paid instances, assigned a private endpoint address.</p><p>You can find the full-length instructions from Oracle <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-rest-data-services/19.4/aelig/installing-and-configuring-customer-managed-ords-autonomous-database.html#GUID-24F4D51F-0BAF-4D3B-A714-492ED02D1212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, on how to set this up. I have however, summarised the steps here, as well as noted the issues I encountered and the solutions.</p><p>These instructions assume that you have the following provisioned:</p><ol><li><strong>Autonomous Database.</strong> Any workload type is fine, and it can be either paid or Always Free.</li><li><strong>Always Free Micro-shape Compute Instance.</strong> The Compute may be of any shape, but the assumption is that it runs Oracle Linux 7.8.</li></ol><blockquote><p>You may attempt to use Oracle Autonomous Linux 7.8, however, many of the packages required are installed using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YUM</a>, and this prebuilt OS image has limited repositories available. While there's a workaround, you are advised in the documentation not to mess with the configuration. If you're interested to know what these are, please check with me privately.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tasklist-for-adb">Tasklist for ADB<a class="hash-link" href="#tasklist-for-adb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-accounts">User Accounts<a class="hash-link" href="#user-accounts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Installing and configuring ORDS usually requires the following accounts:</p><ul><li>APEX_PUBLIC_USER</li><li>APEX_LISTENER</li><li>APEX_REST_PUBLIC_USER</li><li>ORDS_PUBLIC_USER</li></ul><p>The first three are created in a typical APEX installation.

            <description><![CDATA[Java Challenge Coin]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Java Challenge Coin" src="/assets/images/duke-live-to-code-a38ca0217127c4af224c748069e72a9f.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>My personal journey with programming started more than two decades ago. Back then, the one language that I was very passionate and determined to master was Java. Early in my career, I would find any opportunity to attend a Sun Microsystems event like the Sun Tech Days, where I had the opportunity to learn about the constantly evolving platform that went from desktop, to enterprise and then on mobile devices. I can still remember watching the cool things you could do with Lego Mindstorms and an embedded Java runtime, and the vision that <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JXTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JXTA</a> was going to revolutionise the Internet of Things with its state-of-the-art, peer-to-peer technology.</p><p>More importantly though, I was inspired and even as a noob, I got involved in the community through the Singapore Java Users Group. While there have been many incarnations of JUGs in Singapore, SJUG was the group I grew up with. I am grateful to have been involved and the opportunity to get to know luminaries like Dennis Lee (a.k.a. smallfry), <a href="https://twitter.com/chewboonhong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chew Boon Hong</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sausheong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chang Sau Sheong</a>.</p><p>Then there were the Sun Evangelists who travelled to the lesser known place where I spent my growing years. As I watched them on stage, I admired, and perhaps envied them. And it became my dream that some day, I too could be travelling around talking about what I am passionate about. Always being at the cutting edge of technology, trying out cool new toys and then proudly showing everyone else what you can do it. These were my notable few:</p><ul><li>Sang Shin a.k.a. <a href="https://twitter.com/javapassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javapassion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukmunnlee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuk-Mun Lee</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/speakjava" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Ritter</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ragss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rags Srinivas</a></li></ul><p>I never got to be a Sun Evangelist, but I did find a similar path and earned my spades!</p><p>As we commemorate the 25th anniversary of a technology that helped shape the Internet, I wanted to honour the people who inspired me and were in many ways, a role model to me. I will attempt to reach out to you and hopefully be able to send you a Java Challenge Coin as a little token of appreciation.</p><p>From the bottom of my heart, <strong>THANK YOU</strong> for sharing your knowledge and passion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hence, when I heard this <a href="https://joelkallman.blogspot.com/2020/03/seek-where-you-can-help-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">call to help</a>, instinct kicked in and I had to respond.</p><p>I am blessed to have trained, worked and experienced first-hand what <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) can do for organisations, especially in times of urgency and need. My own journey with APEX began with a weekend project that saved our human resource specialist hours of work collecting <strong>54</strong> spreadsheets weekly for <strong>two</strong> months; each time tallying up step counts and reporting the competition standings to the group.</p><p>Today, I see many APEX developers sharing on social media, different ways they have used the technology to help their organisations navigate these challenging times. Others have used their skills and knowledge to help support operational activities at civic organisations and local governments. If you are one of them, please feel free to share your story by commenting below.</p><p>If you are looking to build rapid solutions with APEX, then here are useful resources that you might find useful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="environment">Environment<a class="hash-link" href="#environment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Organisations already licensed to run an Oracle Database, good news, APEX can be installed on your database <em>free of charge</em>. If you do not already own one, then here are some options to consider.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="option-a">Option A<a class="hash-link" href="#option-a" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>APEX available out-of-the-box on the <em>Always Free</em> Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) is the best way to get started. Begin by <a href="http://oracle.com/cloud/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signing up</a> for an Oracle Cloud Free Tier.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="option-b">Option B<a class="hash-link" href="#option-b" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If your organisation is staffed with IT staff familiar with <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> or <a href="http://vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagrant</a>, there are many projects that will help stand up an APEX with a <em>free</em> <a href="http://oracle.com/xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database 18c Express Edition</a>. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker-apex-stack</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/oraclebase/vagrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vagrant</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oraclebase/dockerfiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dockerfiles</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/oraclebase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Hall</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Dani3lSun/docker-db-apex-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker-db-apex-dev</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Dani3lSun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Hochleitner</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="option-c">Option C<a class="hash-link" href="#option-c" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Last but not least, you may <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=4700&amp;p_lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up</a> for a <em>free</em> workspace on <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.oracle.com</a>. While this is the easiest path to obtain an APEX development environment, it is not for production use. It also does not provide you direct access to the database that is sometimes needed in a software development workflow.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning">Learning<a class="hash-link" href="#learning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are a wealth of videos that demonstrate the varioous features of APEX. I strongly recommend the APEX development team's YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEpIXFjcQIztReQNLymvYrQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">channel</a> for starters.</p><p>The open sourced APEX <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/oracle-apex-192-free-curriculum-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curriculum</a> is also available for those looking for a more structured training experience. Direct links to access these resources are as follows:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/learnmore/apex-curriculum-4490003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener

            <description><![CDATA[Happy New Year!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Happy New Year!" src="/assets/images/new-years-day-4649609_1920-e84ce439cf27504c7805bb242950f3f5.jpg" width="1280" height="719" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Probably too late for New Year greetings, but not if you also celebrate the Lunar New Year that's coming really soon. For readers who, like me, celebrate this festival, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you 新年快乐，万事如意!</p><p>It's now been almost a year since the <a href="/content/id/1727">APEX Challenge Coin</a> was released, and I must say, it's made 2019 a year to remember!</p><p>Many people have thanked me for initiating this project, but in my heart, I feel it is everyone who participated - from the givers to the receivers - that I should thank. The project outcome was more than I could imagine. Words aren't even enough to describe the feeling of knowing how much community members were touching each others hearts with simple thoughts and gestures. This world is a better place because of all of you, so thank you!</p><p>I had intended to end the project when the last coin was given out in December 2019. However, when news broke that <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> made the Gartner's Peer Insights <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/customers-choice/enterprise-low-code-application-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customers' Choice for Enterprise Low-Code Application Platforms</a>, I knew at the moment, that there are and will be more APEX developers to show our appreciation too. I am thereby announcing the <strong>launch of the 2020 Edition of the APEX Challenge Coin</strong>!</p><p>While the rules on how someone can earn a coin have not changed, there are a few small tweaks to how this year's coins will be distributed. Firstly, to help me keep my sanity, I am moving away from spreadsheets and will be using APEX to help me maintain records of whom these coins are going to. I've got to eat my own dog food eh?</p><p>Then there's the request/nomination process. Rather than rely solely on Twitter for accepting requests, this year, I have decided that the process should also be "APEX'ified". If you have someone in mind that you'd like to show your appreciation to, please go to this <a href="https://apeks.app/sponsor-a-coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to submit your nomination.</p><p>Many have wondered about how the coins are serialised. I will make no statements to either confirm or deny those allegations, but suffice to say, the answer should be very obvious to a programmer. While I had issued the coins pretty much randomly last year, there were exceptions. For example, when I learned that the number "42" would actually help <a href="https://twitter.com/shakeeb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakeeb Rahmen</a> find the meaning of life, I had no choice but to put it into the reserve pile. This year, I have decided to let sponsors select the number(s) they'd like to gift and you can do so when submitting a nomination. Do note though that the coin's serial number is a primary key, duh!</p><p>There were about 90 coins distributed last year, and it will likely be the same number this year. I had imposed a limit on the number of coins a person could sponsor, and that was to help ensure a fair distribution of coins. That practice will continue going into 2020. What does that mean for folks who sponsored coins last year? For every coin that you had sponsored but have yet to submit a name, then that coin counts against your 2020 limit. For example, if you had sponsored three coins and submitted two names (and hopefully pictures) of the happy owners, then you'll have the opportunity to sponsor four this year. Submit that last name from 2019 and you'll fully restore your "credits" with me.</p><p>Last but not least, I am planning to add a feature on the Sponsor a Coin website to map the global distribution of the coins. This was requested by <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverLemm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Lemm</a> quite a while ago and I hope to have it done in the coming months. Stay tune for that, but meanwhile, think about that colleague, friend, customer or even family member, whom has made an impact on you or your company through their APEX development skills. Consider sponsoring them a coin. Believe me, the experience and result is magical!</p>]]></content:encoded>

What is the size 20G of?"</p></blockquote><p>This is an excellent question to ask before embarking on any <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/autonomous-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autonomous Database</a> (ADB) migration plans and so I dug a bit deeper. </p><p>Folks moving applications and data from an <a href="https://oracle.com/xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Express Edition</a> (XE) instance, version 11gR2 or 18c, will probably not have problems fitting into a Free Tier Autonomous Database (ADB) since database sizes are capped at 11 and 12 GB respectively. You are allowed a maximum of 20 GB user for each Free Tier ADB provisioned. </p><p>To estimate the data size to be migrated, execute the following query as <em>SYS</em> on the source database:</p><div

<code>DATA</code> is the default tablespace for schema users (think <code>USERS</code> tablespace) and is where your application data really lives. Given that <code>TEMP</code>, <code>UNDOTBS1</code> and perhaps <code>UNDO_2</code> have a max of 8 GB, it looks like application data really needs to remain within the confines of 12 GB.

Earlier this year, I took a gamble and started a little <a href="/content/id/1727">social experiment</a> and minted a small batch of APEX Challenge Coins.</p><p>The coins demonstrated our deep appreciation for APEX developers who have impacted our lives. Through the process of distributing them worldwide, I was blessed to have basked in the warmth of givers and the happiness of receivers. Words cannot describe the emotions and joy I felt each time someone opens his or her little mail packet to find a gift of gratitude.</p><p>So... for my #ThanksOGB appreciation post this year, I wanted to express again, my heartfelt gratitude to all APEX Challenge Coin sponsors for making this project a success. Thank you for supporting APEX developers!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Kids&amp;#39; Playground" src="/assets/images/playground-470402_1280x720-d2d15443cc0c8e3630c00eae8e8feca2.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As mentioned in a previous <a href="/content/id/1919">post</a>, the <a href="https://oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Tier</a> for <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud</a> (OCI) is every Oracle Developer's dream. For a while now, I have hosted a personal <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) instance on Linode. It currently runs an older Oracle Database 11gR2 <a href="https://oracle.com/xe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Express Edition</a> (XE), and I would like to upgrade it to version 18c. The key issue I had though, was that the existing virtual machine hosted on <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=41672b20d515344de465e9ed44c1a75356445597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linode</a>, only has one gigabyte of RAM and that does not meet the 18c XE minimum requirement of two. That left me procrastinating for a long time, but perhaps a blessing in disguise. With this new offering, the next steps are pretty obvious.</p><p>After <a href="/content/id/1918">setting up</a> my new OCI development environment, the next task I looked into was exporting an existing workspace, and then importing it into the new APEX instance, hosted on an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-autonomous-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autonomous Database</a> (ADB). During the import process, the you will be asked to either assign an existing schema or create a new one. If you are using an exsiting schema, be sure to include the necessary database privileges for an APEX parsing schema. This all went pretty much as expected, very smoothly!</p><p>However, my workspace did not have an Application Express user, commonly called "admin" (ADMIN), that had workspace access and administrative rights. Hence, I was unable to login to the migrated workspace.</p><p>APEX in ADB is configured to use database user accounts for workspace access. Similar to configuring the workspace access with LDAP, HTTP Header Variable or Social Sign In authentication schemes, a matching Application Express user is required. If your workspace user matches up with a database user, then that user should have no troubles logging in. This user assumes whatever rights the equivalent Application Express user has been granted.</p><p>Suppose I have the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Workspace</strong>: myworkspace</li><li><strong>Schema</strong>: myschema</li><li><strong>Administrator's username</strong>: jdoe</li></ul><p>To allow JDOE access to the workspace, create a database user with the same name. Do this using either SQL Developer, SQL*PLus or SQLcl. Instructions to connect to the ADB can be found <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/connect-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Login as ADMIN, the administrator account created when the ADB was provisioned.</p><p>Once connected, execute the command:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">create</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">user</span><span class="token plain"> jdoe identified </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">by</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"mySuper!P@55"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>For the purpose of authenticating to APEX, no specific privileges or quota's are necessary. Login to the workspace using the workspace and database user's credentials.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Set APEX account password" src="/assets/images/set-apex-account-password-515bdaf8576cd01a2ce22e2057e96f4e.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Application Express account with the same username will need to have its password reset. If this is not done, you will continually be prompted to do so. Strangely, clicking on that big blue button and then using the password change dialog does not seem to perform this successfully for me. What worked was using the user and group management utilities and then forced setting the user's password.</p><p>Alternatively, before exporting the workspace, create an APEX workspace administrator with the same username as its schema, e.g. MYSCHEMA. Note that the ADB's APEX Instance Administration functionality is severely limited and does not appear to allow management of workspace users and groups, so the user must be added from the old instance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workspace-authentication-with-database-accounts">Workspace Authentication with Database Accounts<a class="hash-link" href="#workspace-authentication-with-database-accounts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>How Oracle has laid out the approach for managing the APEX environment is limiting, but for good reason. It also does present a different perspective on how an administrator manages developer access to the resource.</p><p>We know that with ADB, we have access to a variety of tools for using the dataabase:</p><ul><li>APEX</li><li>SQL Developer Web (SQLDEVWEB)</li><li>Oracle ML SQL Notebooks (OML)</li><li>SQL Developer (SQLDEV)</li><li>SQLcl</li><li>Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS); and</li><li>Traditional connectors like OCI, JDBC and ODBC.</li></ul><p>An indispensible item in an APEX developer toolchain is access to the database schema. The ability to browse, modify and compile schema objects are an essential part of what we do. Depending on company policies and best practices, there are varying access levels and approaches. For example, workspaces available on apex.oracle.com, only allows developers to access the database schema through SQL Workshop. I'm sure you'd agree, this impacts developer productivity. </p><p>For corporate APEX instances however, it's not uncommon for database administrators to dish out the schema credentials to developers, either in the form of usernames and passwords, or an encrypted SQLDEV connnection export file. But what happens when the password expires, or one of the developers decide to change the it?</p><p>One approach I'm inclined to use these days is to create for developers, a personal account, and then grant them ability to proxy as the APEX schema user.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">-- As a privileged user, execute:</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">alter</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">user</span><span class="token plain"> myschema </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">grant</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">connect</span><span class="token plain"> through jdoe</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>In the context of APEX+ADB, here are some examples of how we could benefit from this approach:</p><ul><li>JDOE uses <strong>one</strong> account to access APEX App Builder and workspace schema user using the tool of choice. For example, JDOE could connect to the database as MYSCHEMA by simply authenticating using the username <code>jdoe[myschema]</code> and logon with his/her password.</li><li>DBAs can, through profiles, apply standards like password expiration and complexity. When a developer leaves the organisation, there is no need to reset the schema password and communicate that to everyone else involved.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sql-developer-web">SQL Developer Web<a class="hash-link" href="#sql-developer-web" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To enable access to a schema, it must first be REST-enabled. For schemas linked to APEX workspaces, one option is to use the RESTful Services utility. For other schemas though, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/sql-developer-web/19.1/sdweb/about-sdw.html#GUID-A79032C3-86DC-4547-8D39-85674334B4FE" target="_blank" rel="noopener

Either enable users through OML as ADMIN, or grant users the role <code>OML_DEVELOPER</code>. OML users are provisioned personal workspaces that they could then grant other developers access to.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A helping hand" src="/assets/images/baby-560891_1280x720-1fa440b1dfcab715883df2bf87e752fa.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Too good to be true? No, it's true!!!</p><p>After hearing the rumours for a few years now, Mr Larry Ellison finally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pkV26sI7D0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the availablility of a Free Tier for the Oracle Cloud. The gift bundle includes <strong>two</strong> small compute instances and <strong>two</strong> <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-autonomous-database.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autonomous Databases</a>. These offerings are a tiny fraction of what the Oracle Cloud provides, but are sufficient for Oracle Developers to maintain their own 24x7 development environments and possibly even production applications for small businesses and non-profit organisations.</p><p>Like everyone else in the <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> community, I wasted no time in getting my account provisioned and am currently working towards moving workspaces and applications from my old personal APEX instance, hosted on <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=41672b20d515344de465e9ed44c1a75356445597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linode</a>.</p><p>To get started, simply click on this <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> and sign up. The process is similar to what I had earlier described in this <a href="/content/id/1903">post</a>. You will need to decide on a tenant name and home region. The home region is where all <em>Always Free</em> resources will be created. Afterwhich, you will be asked to provide your cellphone number and credit card information for verification. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Layout of resources" src="/assets/images/oci-architecture-diagram-12eea99f0c04202dd3cf593709cbea8d.png" width="983" height="714" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I am an APEX developer by trade, so setting up a working APEX instance was top on the list. The Autonomous Database comes with APEX included, so setting that up was an easy sequence of mouse clicks and keystrokes. For my main database, I went with an Automous Transaction Processing (ATP) database. </p><p>Unfortunately, on the backburner, is a convenient method for enabling "vanity URLs" that we are still waiting for Oracle to provide. Meanwhile, there are workarounds using a web server to proxy HTTP traffic, and so, to facilitate that, I also provisioned a compute instance and installed <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a>. I intend to develop using other programming languages and so, running an Apache web server in a container made sense. Besides, running <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certbot</a> to manage <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Encrypt</a> certificates was much easier.</p><p>Ideally, I would situate the ATP in a private subnet, away from the prying eyes of the Internet, but it is a shared infrastructure and there are limitations. There are ways to restrict database connections through the use of access control lists, but it doesn't allow, for example, the database to access a REST API running on a second compute instance over a private network.</p><p>For the second set of <em>Always Free</em> resources, I intend to setup an Autonomous Datawarehouse (ADW) and a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> Notebook instance for refreshing my knowledge on Machine Learning, stay tuned to hear more about that.</p><p>If you needed more guidance on creating these resources, please check out some of my previous posts on creating and accessing these resources:</p><ul><li><a href="/content/id/1904">Compute instance</a></li><li><a href="/content/id/1911">Autonomous Database</a></li></ul><p>Note that since publishing these posts, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console has changed somewhat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since the <a href="https://tryapexnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early adopter</a> programme was launched on September 13, 2019, Mike has tweeted seven times about the EA (up till Sep 15).</p><p>{% twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1172569124528017410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1172569124528017410</a> %}</p><p>You can find his other tweets here, describing how fast and easy it is to build these advanced search pages:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1172573900871389184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1172573900871389184</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173017312238030848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173017312238030848</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173019129504100352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173019129504100352</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173359613573353473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173359613573353473</a></li></ul><p>I share the same excitement and here's why.</p><p>For a little over two years, I was involved in a multi-centre research project that sought to collect and store donor biospecimen from across the province of British Columnbia. There were very strict ethics and privacy protocols on not only specimen collection, but also the process of obtaining and storing patient and specimen data. Deidentified data would be aggregated in a web portal for biomedical scientists to search and request suitable biomaterial for their studies. You can read more about the project <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785772/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>My then supervisor, Mark Wilkinson, was a huge proponent of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Web</a> and was meticulous about storing accurate metadata and making data easily searchable by both human and machines. Each row of biospecimn data must be carefully characterised using ontological concepts, and then exposed on the web as structured data.</p><p>The semantically rich data would then either be:</p><ul><li>Consumed by machines (applications)</li><li>Searched using a semantic query language like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPARQL</a>; or</li><li>Visually using a tool like <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/exhibit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIMILE Exhibit</a></li></ul><p>Let's build a Movie Database Application to illustrate how <em>Faceted Search</em> helps guide a user to search the data. Rather than list the steps, the video below demonstrates how to import the movie dataset and then create an application that includes both an Interactive Report (IR) and a Faceted Search interface.</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>Suppose we wanted to look for the following:</p><blockquote><p>A list of dramas from Asia that were released before the year 2000. </p></blockquote><p>Let's first begin by searching for this data using the IR page:</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>Now do the same using the Faceted Search user interface (UI):</p><div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>It typically takes about twice as long to get the desired result set using the IR. More importantly though, the facets provide a visual summary of the entire dataset, with a list of distinct groups of values and a row count of each group that help guide how a user might drilldown the data.</p><p>Before 19.2, such a sophisticated UI would require quite a bit more time to implement. In a previous project for a leading university library consortium, our team at <a href="https://insum.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insum</a> helped create a flexible search UI that incorporated Faceted Search using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/index-098492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Text</a> technology. The latter has other strengths and I would be surprised if there was a way to use it with this new APEX functionality.</p><p>Here's a quick list of tasks to introduce Faceted Search to an existing application.</p><ol><li>After creating a page, add a Classic Report region using the table or query of your choice for data source. It doesn't appear to support both Interactive Reports and Interactive Grids.</li><li>Add a new region and select the new <em>Faceted Search</em> type. Change the page template to <em>Left Side Column</em> and place the new reigon on the <em>Left Column</em>.</li><li>Next, under <em>Source</em>, select the report for the <em>Filtered Region</em><img

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>I'm embarrassed. If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=a+case+for+markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">googled</a> this title, you'd find many other previous blog posts discussing the utility of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>. And in my humble opinion, it can be fully justified depending on the purpose.</p><p>With the launch of the <a href="https://tryapexnow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early adopter programme</a> for <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX), developers now access to what the APEX Development Team has been working on these past few months. What appears not to be mentioned in the mew <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=192192:FEATURES" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features page</a> is a list of new page items.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A list of available page items in versions 19.1 and 19.2 EA" src="/assets/images/page-items--then-and-now-85ae5c6bd63747eda2634c5d59d096a3.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I think it's pretty obvious which of the two new page items stand out. Just check out these tweets that came out soon after the EA programme was announced.</p><blockquote><p>@martindsouza <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza/status/1172589077947830272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/martindsouza/status/1172589077947830272</a>
And thank you @OracleAPEX for adding native markdown support. Been waiting for this for a long time!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>@commi235 <a href="https://twitter.com/commi235/status/1172599174161981440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/commi235/status/1172599174161981440</a>
Thanks #orclapex for finally giving us a modern, quick and easy way to style comments. 👍</p></blockquote><p>As a developer, I use many platforms like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a> etc. daily. I usually write code, notes and other text using a simple editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Visual Code</a> (VS Code), focusing on content and structure than styling, as it should be! And because these platforms all support Markdown, I can easily transfer the text between applications.</p><p>I am pretty sure most developers have felt the pain of formatting code when writing technical documentation using Microsoft Word.</p><p>Consider this simple block of code:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">declare</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  l_name varchar2</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">8</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> :</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'John Doe'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">begin</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  dbms_output</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">put_line</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'Hello '</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">||</span><span class="token plain"> l_name</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">end</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>To write this in MS Word, here's what I might typically do:</p><ol><li>Copy the code to the clipboard.</li><li>Paste the text in Word in <strong>plaintext</strong>.</li><li>Select the code and change the Font to something that's fixed-width, e.g. Courier.</li><li>Depending on the language, select each keyword and format to stand out.</li></ol><p>How do we do the same with Markdown?</p><ol><li>Copy the code to the clipboard.</li><li>Paste the text in GitHub issue description for example.</li><li>Enclose the code with <code>`<!-- -->`<!-- -->`<!-- -->sql</code> and <code>`<!-- -->`<!-- -->`</code>.</li></ol><p>Done!

Markdown today, is still very much an acquired taste. A typical end user would probably be more comfortable editing formatted text usng a WYSIWYG editor and that option is still there in APEX.</p><p>The other consideration is the support for Markdown content in the database. Consider the text:</p><blockquote><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p></blockquote><p>Suppose the user wanted to bold the word "Aldus" but not "PageMaker". Using the Rich Text Editor page item, the string would be stored as <code>&lt;strong&gt;Aldus&lt;/strong&gt; PageMaker</code>, while the Markdown Editor, would store that as <code>**Aldus** PageMaker</code>.</p><p>To query the data for the phrase "Aldus PageMaker", you can quite easily find the latter using regular expression (<code>regexp_like</code>). To correctly search the HTML-formatted string, either strip the HTML elements or use <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/index-098492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Text</a>. Using the appropriate <code>CONTAINS</code> operator, e.g. <code>ABOUT</code>, it is possible to ignore HTML markup. It might take a few more steps to also ignore Markdown syntax, but not impossible.</p><p>The other drawback with Markdown would be functionality like "Remove HTML" when choosing how an Interactive Report is displayed. There's yet to be a "Remove Markdown" option.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Remove HTML" src="/assets/images/remove-html-2d007e3809292ece02f8e56a3e6ee994.png" width="357" height="180" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There are often many solutions to a puzzle. Having options is great, and using Markdown in APEX out-of-the-box is certainly welcomed! One thing's for sure, moving towards simplicity doesn't mean walking backwards.</p><p><em>This blog post was proudly written in Markdown.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

With the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Development Extension Pack</a>, developers are able to work with code on remote servers using SSH, <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> containers and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.</p><p>Before, working on Windows almost exclusively, I have had the challenge of running and developing with Docker containers using a virtual machine (VM) running Linux. It gets a little tricky at times trying to synchronize the code between the host system and VM. Hence the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote SSH</a> extension was a great boost for productivity! I could work on my code on the host system while using VS Code's terminal to interact with the VM and Docker service.</p><p>It gets even better with Docker running on the host and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Container</a> extension. Microsoft provides a few sample projects to get started with various programming languages, but I wanted something that was designed to work for the Oracle Developer and engineered to attach to an Oracle Database. And so, starting with <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>, I created this <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/vscode-remote-oradev-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit</a>.</p><p>Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/vscode-remote-oradev-python/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a> file for more details.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Having used the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud (OCI)</a> both in my day job and as a technology evangelist, I have had the opportunity to engage Oracle support at various levels: sales, customer and technical.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sales-support">Sales Support<a class="hash-link" href="#sales-support" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When I first signed up for a trial, Oracle was quick to assign some to ensure that you were making full use of your trial account and credits. While I found their varying job titles confusing, generally, their goals were simple:</p><ol><li>Understand why you have signed up for the cloud trial.</li><li>Are there any technical challenges and if so, how they could setup some calls with inside technical specialists who could help address those issues.</li></ol><p>I didn't particularly feel a strong pressure to make any purchases, at least not during the initial calls and email correspondences, but perhaps because I was quick to make clear my intentions for participating in the trial.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="customer-support">Customer Support<a class="hash-link" href="#customer-support" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Live chat options" src="/assets/images/chat_options-fde5e81b711b5bc7ae800b5c03d72aee.jpg" width="389" height="488" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Last Friday, I applied for a new cloud trial account on behalf of a non-profit organization. Unfortunately, we had an issue with our DNS MX records and so I was worried that the activation email would be lost. Thankfully, and rather unexpectedly, I was able to locate a button on the to of the Oracle Cloud homepage that gave me several options to start a live chat with a customer support agent. I was close to the start of the chat hours that day and so, was able to connect with a support agent online. He was able to identify my application, but unfortunately, the issue had to be handled by a different department.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cloud Support Chat Hours:</strong>
7.30 pm to 3.30 PM the next day, Pacific Time</p></blockquote><p>Although he wasn't able to help me directly, I definitely appreciated that I could at least "talk" to someone and have some options for next steps, rather than simply just hitting a brick wall. I did eventually get answers as to what went wrong with my trial application and you can read more about this in the <a href="#Three-Tries-and-I%E2%80%99m-Out">last section</a> of this article.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-support-mos">Technical Support (MOS)<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-support-mos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>While I did not have the opportunity to engage the technical support team, the last serious incident I remember, involved an OCI <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/overview.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DB System</a> related to a cascade of unexpected events at the data centre. We had contacted <a href="https://support.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Oracle Support</a> team as soon as the problem was discovered and were able to have an initial call within a short amount of time.</p><p>After providing the necessary details (logs and error messages), the support agent was able to quickly assemble a team made up of specialists supporting the different tiers in the infrastructure. There was never a mention about reproducibility or anything like that, as these systems were running off Oracle's hardware and software systems.</p><p>We all have our bad days with support teams in general. However, at least for us, this encounter turned out just fine. The MOS team members were fully committed and eventually able to identify the cause and resolved all issues. The DB System was back online and functioning normally in a matter of hours. Phew!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="three-tries-and-im-out">Three Tries and I'm Out<a class="hash-link" href="#three-tries-and-im-out" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Just last week, I wanted to initiate a new trial with an intention to progress into a paying account. To my dismay, I was told that it was rejected because I had signed up for one too many trials. Here's how they added up.</p><p>I created my first trial to learn the process and also try out many of the different features outside of my regular scope of work. The next one was started to document my 30-day adventures, but then I got busy, had to to take a break and time eventually ran out. Earlier this month, I started my third trial so that I could complete writing up this series.</p><p>Each customer is limited to only <strong>three</strong> trials, so be warned! While you may use different email addresses to sign up, either the cellphone/mobile number that you provide, or credit card information used for verification, could eventually be used to link all your trial accounts. I wasn't aware of this limitation, but while it's coming around to bite me, I do not regret attempting to document a complete 30-day Oracle Trial experience.</p><p>This post completes my story and I hope it has brought some value to you. If you were sitting on the fence or adverse to the cloud, I strongly recommend taking the 30-day trial and have any doubts answered. Regardless on what you eventually decide on, I am sure you have much to gain by learning and experiencing the platform of the future.</p><p>As an aside, I just wanted to mention that for the trials, I had been using an arbitrary string for the tenant name. It was fortunate that I was able to request a name change that suites the organization I was applying on behalf of. I had also used an unaffiliated email address for the Cloud Administrator/Owner account, and was able to quickly remedy this by creating a new account. Then with a single button click, copied over all the same roles that the original sign-up account had. What a relief!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ideally, each Fn function serves one, and only one purpose. It can be implemented in wide variety of programming languages and they are listed <a href="https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/cli/ref/fn-init.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (see the list of runtime options available).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-environment-setup">Development Environment Setup<a class="hash-link" href="#development-environment-setup" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Fn project provides a concise <a href="https://fnproject.io/tutorials/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of instructions</a> on installing the Fn command line interface (CLI) utility. The CLI allows developers to run a Fn server locally, and perform developer and deployment client functions.</p><p>A rather recent version of <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> is required, and if you are on a Microsoft Windows machine, I highly recommend installing <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Box</a> and running a Linux virtual machine (VM) for Fn development.

I have enrolled in yet another <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trial</a>, so I am hoping to continue where I left off and share my thirty day adventure with an <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud</a> trial. I'm on Day 14 now, and for this post, I'll examine an important issue that many of us face, even in our personal life - moving houses!</p><p>Suppose I had a compute instance running <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> to perform some proof of concept tasks and now I am ready to move it from my Oracle Cloud tenancy to a client's. There are several recipes for achieving this goal. I could for example, use the Oracle Database's backup and recovery, or data migration tools, but is there a simpler approach? What if I could clone the server and then ship it over to be deployed on my client's tenancy?</p><p>This is definitely possible and I will walk you through a simple procedure to perform this migration exercise.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-and-export-a-custom-image">Create and Export a Custom Image<a class="hash-link" href="#create-and-export-a-custom-image" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First, on the source tenant, create a custom image of the compute instance and then prepare the image for export.</p><ol><li>Click <i class="fa-solid fa-bars"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Compute <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Instances.</li><li>Place the mouse cursor over the <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-h"></i> and then click "Create Custom Image". <strong>WARNING</strong>: this will initiate a system shutdown on the target instance!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Oracle Downtown Seattle Office Building" src="/assets/images/oracle_seattle-6359f0f5f71664d9c23cde42f7ac1ac3.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I was glad to be back in Seattle to attend the 2019 edition of ODTUG's famed Kscope conference. This is the second time the event is held this close to home (read my <a href="/content/id/391">previous recount</a> of the same conference five years ago)! And like every Kscope before, the conference always provides unique experiences, bountiful knowledge and new people to meet! Here's a quick summary and highlights of my week.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sessions">Sessions<a class="hash-link" href="#sessions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I'd generally group Kscope <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> and Database (DB) sessions into the following categories and that helps me decide what I should attend:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-insights-to-whats-next---attend-the-sunday-symposium-sessions">1. Insights to what's next - attend the Sunday Symposium sessions.<a class="hash-link" href="#1-insights-to-whats-next---attend-the-sunday-symposium-sessions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>My takeaways? Here are the two new 19.2 features that I am looking forward to:</p><ol><li>Faceted search support for reports</li><li>Enhanced List of Values</li></ol><p>There are more cool stuff to come, but these are my top picks as I can see them being useful in Research Data Management (RDM) applications.</p><p>Then of course there were the big announcements, though it wasn't really much of a surprise as rumours about APEX coming to the Autonomous DB have been floating around for quite a while.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Announcement that APEX is now available with Autonomous DB" src="/assets/images/autonomous_apex-b7dda3b61a04c4dd99b9bd339b5db822.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I enjoyed attending <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLMaria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maria Colgan's</a> session where she described the "autonomous" in Autonomous DB. It was exciting to learn that "Machine Learning" wasn't just a buzzword and it isn't driven by "Deep Learning". Instead, there are very down-to-earth knowledge engineering (KE) techniques that were employed to enhance, an already robust relational database system, with self-healing and auto-indexing.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A slide describing two KE techniques that drive the auto-indexing feature in the Autonomous DB." src="/assets/images/autonomousdb_auto_indexing-0c87b85697694d5fdaf36829e48154d5.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-support-core-expertise---attend-apex-and-db-sessions-that-directly-impact-my-day-job">2.

I'm certainly looking forward to the 19.2 release!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SQLcl help with new commands highlighted." src="/assets/images/sqlcl_new_stuff-a51e3a426f6510b33e09d563ff7470e2.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-broaden-skill-set---attend-db-sessions-on-topics-that-are-sometimes-out-of-my-current-job-scope">3.

I have been hearing a lot about this new approach to building for exposing data as APIs during Node+JS Interactive events in the past, but never delved deeper. Now I'm inspired!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="emerging-technology">Emerging Technology<a class="hash-link" href="#emerging-technology" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This year, I was honoured to be on the team that helped select a list of eleven sessions that covered topics that were considered "emerging":</p><ul><li>Blockchain</li><li>Internet of Things (IoT)</li><li>Machine Learning</li><li>Robotic Process Automation (RPA); and</li><li>Serverless Computing</li></ul><p>Four of them are topics that I am very passionate about and would have liked to attend all of them, but with so many tracks and concurrent activities going on, it was really hard to sit in on all of them. Thank goodness for the recordings that are to come!</p><p>My fingers and toes are crossed. I hope that we will continue to find space to learn about things that are out of our core expertise. To the conference committee, yes, I'll volunteer again if called upon to perform this duty.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-session---the-magician">General Session - The Magician<a class="hash-link" href="#general-session---the-magician" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It's been a while since I last attended a magic show and so this year's General Session was a treat. <a href="https://www.jasonlatimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Latimer</a> is a great showman and I was pretty much floored by a few of his tricks. I tried repeating the half-filled, inverted glass trick at home, but only succeeded in drenching the countertop.</p><p>The more important message however, echoes one of the conversations we had during the Unconference session. We have to keep learning, testing boundaries and challenging the status quo. Never settle for enough or risk becoming obsolete.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="achievements">Achievements<a class="hash-link" href="#achievements" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In 2018, I was honoured to join the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oracle-ace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle ACE Program</a> as an Oracle ACE Associate. This year, I am again privileged to have been promoted to an Oracle ACE. Typically, these awards are announced at a private dinner event, so it was quite a surprise that they were made public during the prelude to General Session.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Oracle ACE Program Announcements" src="/assets/images/oracle_ace_program_announcements-f35b6f26926a94eb9791c82b09cbe972.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Again, my heartiest congratulations to everyone whose names were on that slide!</p><p>Next, certifications. It was not easy feat, but thanks to ODTUG and the conference committee, IMHO, the <a href="https://kscope19.odtug.com/page/oracle-test-fest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Test Fest</a> was a success. I knew of quite a few APEX developers who were certified during the three days of testing. For me, thankfully, I achieved my certification goals for 2019 by attaining certifications for both APEX 18 and the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud</a>. Phew!</p><p>This is probably my most bountiful Kscope ever!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenge-coins-for-good">Challenge Coins for Good<a class="hash-link" href="#challenge-coins-for-good" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Side-by-side: the APEX and OracleIaaS Challenge Coin" src="/assets/images/challenge_coin_buddies-a1027762bde11d8af16f386459026dbe.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>ICYMI, I made a bunch of APEX Challenge Coins <a href="/content/id/1727">a few months ago</a> and since then, more than half of them have been sponsored and distributed worldwide. To promote the development of the Oracle IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) community, <a href="https://twitter.com/lucdemanche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luc Demanche</a> and I collaborated on an OCI Administrator Challenge Coin and I am happy to share that a few of them have already gone out to deserving people. The rules are pretty much the same:</p><ol><li>Actively manage an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenant and/or architecture solutions using OCI features.</li><li>Have performed exceedingly well in your professional career and/or contributed significantly to the community or an individual.</li><li>Know someone who thinks you have met both requirements (1) and (2).</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Supporting both the Pike Market Food Bank and celebrating outstanding individuals." src="/assets/images/apex_challenge_coin-b8e92a85de7e6994d40dcecb16280b62.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Kscope events are also great opportunities to give back to the larger community. This is evident by the annual community service events. There are many ways to give back, and this year, I found the opportunity for some us to contribute to the <a href="http://www.pmfb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pike Market Food Bank</a> through the sponsorship of coins, awarded to individuals attending the conference. I am thankful for the support received from the following sponsors:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/joelkallman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Kallman</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/stefan__dobre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefan Dobre</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/nielsdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niels de Bruijn</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/_KaiDonato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kai Donato</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/HeyAlfredoDBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfredo Abate</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/StAmourMichel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michel St-Amour</a>; and</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/shakeeb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakeeb Rahman</a></li></ul><p>Together, we managed to collect USD 334.29 that I'm sure the food bank would put to good use and feed the hungry.</p><p>I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the many others who have sponsored coins since both programmes started. I believe these coins mean a lot to those who have received one, and knowing that they do, touches my heart too. So thank you!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="special-moments">Special Moments<a class="hash-link" href="#special-moments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I had quite a bit of fun "competing" with <a href="https://twitter.com/GeraldVenzl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerald Venzl</a> over who has the coolest conference badge. That lead me to fire up my 3D printer and acquire some really cool electronics and come up with this:</p><p>It didn't bag me any prizes, but what I got was even more valuable, a new friend! I am very honoured to have met master tinkerer <a href="https://twitter.com/recursivecodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd Sharp</a>. OK, and yes, I received a nice gift too, an Oracle <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/codecard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Card</a>!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="An Oracle Code Card" src="/assets/images/oracle_code_card-c7d63e0ed09b33d472a1923b147034c4.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can expect me to write more about the <a href="https://www.espressif.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espressif</a> chips, <a href="https://www.eink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E Ink</a> and how they relate to APEX in future posts!</p><p>The other special Kscope moment was meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/mtremblaydev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxime Tremblay</a> while waiting for my 24-minute flight from Vancouver to Seattle. ICYMI, Max recently started <a href="https://askmax.solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">askMax</a>.

Surprising to me, he wasn't the only one. I found out later that <a href="https://twitter.com/CRuepprich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christoph Ruepprich</a> travelled with his pair of coins as well!

I am one of those individuals that have benefited from your strong mentorship and canvassing to enroll me into the ACE program.

Enough said.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin D'Souza</a> - you got me to Seattle five years ago and then took a flight home the next day. This year, you didn't show up at all. Something about city that you don't like?</li><li>My bosses at <a href="https://insum.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insum</a> - thank you for supporting my constant desire to be at Kscope conferences.</li></ul><p>And for everyone who came to my Who's Who in APEX session, thank you!

With VMware Workstation, system administrators had the ability to "move" a virtual machine (VM) from a local workstation to vSphere. It was no surprise then that I was very exited (and itching to play) when <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox</a> 6.0 was released with a new feature: support for exporting a VM to <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/iaas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</a>!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell<a class="hash-link" href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here are major tasks that we need to accomplish:</p><ol><li><a href="#Preparing-OCI-Compartments-and-Networks">Prepare OCI to receive our VM</a></li><li><a href="#Create-OCI-User-and-Generate-API-Key">Create an OCI user and generate an API key</a></li><li><a href="#Create-a-Bucket-on-the-Object-Store">Create a Bucket in the Object Store</a></li><li><a href="#Add-a-Cloud-Profile">Configure VirtualBox 6, add a Cloud Profile</a></li><li><a href="#Deploy-a-VM-to-the-Cloud">Deploy a VM to the OCI</a></li></ol><blockquote><p>All tasks were performed in a Windows environment.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparing-oci---compartments-and-networks">Preparing OCI - Compartments and Networks<a class="hash-link" href="#preparing-oci---compartments-and-networks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On <a href="/content/id/1904">Day 2 of our journey</a>, we went through some of the steps needed to successfully deploy a Compute Instance (VM). Follow the instructions to create a compartment and the required network components, but <strong>do not</strong> create the Compute Instance. One cool feature I failed to mention in that article though, was the "easy option". I had gone through step-by-step, how to create the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), subnets, an Internet Gateway and a Route Table, which is important should you need to customise the network layout. However, the OCI does offer us a simple alternative:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick VCN Setup" src="/assets/images/oci-vcn-simple-bb6e01125e662bd4d3a7335606286f14.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Selecting the option <em>CREATE VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK PLUS RELATED RESOURCES</em> will automatically create the VCN, an Internet Gateway, a Route Table and three public subnets, with one in every Availability Domain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-oci-user-and-generate-api-key">Create OCI User and Generate API Key<a class="hash-link" href="#create-oci-user-and-generate-api-key" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>An <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/paas/identity-cloud-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS)</a> account is provisioned when a cloud account is created.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo by Steve Buissinne" src="/assets/images/insurance-539659_1280x720-fe0c02688738fd681b2f4fd4eec83a32.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It took a little longer than I had hoped to publish the next article in this series about my experience with a 30-day Oracle Cloud trial. I had a created compute instance in the same <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compartment</a> and that messed up my estimates. That's just one piece of the puzzle.</p><p>The other shocking observation was that hosting the database was terribly cheap and we're talking about Oracle pricing. <i class="fa-regular fa-smile-wink"></i></p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Database Cloud Service</a> is available on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and featured as an easy to deploy and configure database system. They are available as a Virtual Machine (VM), Bare Metal servers or on state-of-the-art Exadata hardware. Customers can either provision them with the database license included or BYOL (Bring Your Own License). You can get the latest pricing for this service <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/database/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cost estimates for an OCI DB System" src="/assets/images/oci-dbcs-costs-c97bf4f3d71b299d95f9a09ed794841c.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the case of the trial account, it appears that I am only being "billed" for the cost of resources needed to run a DB System:</p><ul><li>CA$0.086 per OCPU hour - this is the price for a <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/iaas/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VM.Standard2.1</a> VM that comes with 1 OCPU and 15 GB memory.</li><li>CA$0.0573 for 1 GB per month of Block Storage - usage for the day was 22.97 GB that totals to approximately 712 GB per month. This is the smallest capacity that can be provisioned for a DB system, of which, 256 GB is for user data.</li><li>CA$0.0343842 for 1 GB per month of Object Storage - I had performed only one full backup. For the trial it seems impossible to enable automatic daily backups that would been useful to have a better sense of true costs. The usage for a backup without creating any data was 0.02 GB. That amounts to approximately 0.62 GB for the month. I did not do any recovery or anything that might have been considered a "request", so no charges were incurred there.</li></ul><p>In the absence of an actual charge on using a fully-licensed Standard Edition database, I am forced to rely on how much it would cost to host the DB System through their web pricing, which is CA$0.5437 per OCPU hour. Using the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/cost-estimator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Estimator</a>, that amounts to about CA$404.51 per month. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I will also assume that one would need to budget for the minimum 712 GB Block Storage and any Object Storage usage. They aren't terribly expensive, but it's good to have that buffer and not be surprised at the end of the pay period.</p><p>In the case of using Object Storage for RMAN backups, it would be worth noting that in the Cost Estimator, the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/database_backup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Backup Cloud Service</a> is available and can be added to the configuration. It costs more than the "regular" Object Storage charges but according to the pricing calculator, has unlimited <strong>inbound</strong> data transfer and DELETE requests. There will likely be other charges (<strong>outbound</strong> data transfers and requests) should recovery be needed or creating a new DB System from the backups.</p><p>While pay-per-use models might seem to be a fairer way of charging customers, it does add a huge layer of complexity when estimating costs. For that reason, it's no wonder why developers find the OCI (or even Amazon Web Services) "hard" and prefer more budgeting-friendly cloud providers like <a href="https://m.do.co/c/6f9b549ca569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=41672b20d515344de465e9ed44c1a75356445597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linode</a>.</p><p>That being said, none of these developer-friendly platforms provides Oracle Database Standard Edition and up. Spending about CA$4,848 annually would almost seem reasonable compared to hosting on-premise considering the cost of:</p><ol><li>Hardware - servers, network, power and redundancy equipment</li><li>Software licenses</li><li>Physical space to house the equipment</li><li>Other systems and equipment needed to ensure uptime and security</li><li>Specialists for maintaining equipment, network and systems</li></ol><p>Probably the only non-subscription cost that is needed is for hiring a qualified expert, the <strong>OCI Administrator</strong>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div data-testid="general-observer" class="mdx-embed"><div style="height:0;width:100%"></div></div><p>Remember this ad?</p><p>IBM BladeCenters were revolutionary at its time. System Administrators would know that one of the largest expense when building out a server infrastructure is real estate costs. Shrinking racks of servers and consolidating into blade servers meant you could put more hardware in less space. However, they were expensive and had their fair share of skeptics. Adopting a proprietary backbone simply meant you were investing into a brand and hence subject to vendor lock-in.</p><p>Then came virtualization. With more powerful CPUs, cheaper RAMs and more cost-effective storage solutions, we are now able to cramp more servers into a single server. Other pieces of traditional server infrastructure, e.g. network and storage, could be "software-defined". The server footprint very much "vanished into thin air"!</p><p>Think of the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/iaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</a> as your server room in the cloud. With OCI, customers have access to the basic components needed for every server infrastructure and more! Besides virtual networks, firewalls, machines and storage, customers also have access to various specialty appliances and services. That includes autonomous database systems and container services. You can access the OCI console using a URL like <code>https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/?tenant=&lt;MY_TENANT&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;MY_TENANT&gt;</code> is the name of your tenancy. Login with the Oracle Cloud credentials.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="OCI Console" src="/assets/images/oci-console-landing-page-dacf1d0f80d05d4737638a781edce5f0.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As an avid <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> fan, my main interest is always about setting up the components necessary to build my APEX Stack.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo by JuergenPM" src="/assets/images/tree-247122_1280x720-557c8e33a3df75431836b0e3d4fa9873.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I have read many comments on social media and blogs about various experiences using the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud</a> for hosting web applications and databases. There are probably more bad than good accounts, and so I wanted to experience the process myself using a trial subscription.</p><p>Typically, a trial account only gets you a US$300 credit to use on the Oracle Cloud. The credits are good 30 days, after that, either your upgrade to a paid plan, or you lose everything. You are also required to provide a valid credit card for verification purposes only. According to the sign up page, users are only billed after choosing to "upgrade" the account.</p><p><del>Incidentally, and very timely, Oracle had a cloud workshop planned in Vancouver, and I was enrolled in a custom trial that will allow me to participate fully during the workshop. <strong>Thank you Oracle!</strong></del></p><p>Couldn't get their approval to blog about the trial. Started another trial that I can use for this project, but had to follow through on the verification project, so see below with the additional steps needed to get your trial started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="objectives">Objectives<a class="hash-link" href="#objectives" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To get started, here are a few questions I'd like answered through the trial:</p><ol><li>How difficult is it to sign up for the service?</li><li>What services do I have access to?</li><li>What do I need to do to create an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> stack?</li><li>What developer tools that can improve my productivity as an APEX developer and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Administrator?</li><li>How much does it really cost?</li></ol><p>As the trial was a welcomed surprise, I haven't really had the chance to plan the series, so the list of questions here are organic. I am of course, open to suggestions, so if there are any questions that I can help answer, please leave me a comment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disclosure-statement">Disclosure Statement<a class="hash-link" href="#disclosure-statement" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ol><li>I do have some experience working with Oracle Cloud products, but this was my first attempt at setting up an account.</li><li>I work for a company that provides services to manage customers' Oracle Cloud services. However, any opinions expressed in this blog series and on my personal blog site are my own and in no way represents the views of my employer.</li><li>The custom trial account I have used to write this blog series was intended to be used for a workshop. Using it to write these articles are solely out of convenience of not setting up a separate trial subscription.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sign-up">Sign Up<a class="hash-link" href="#sign-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As part of the pre-workshop administration process, the folks at Oracle were quick to provide me an email containing a sign up link for the custom trial account. That brought me to a page very similar to the regular sign up page, minus the requirements for submitting a credit card for verification.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Oracle Cloud Trial Sign Up Page" src="/assets/images/oci-trial-signup-662b5dc9103ea333602f11cb89be2518.png" width="1041" height="784" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><del>There were no hassles involved here, but I wonder what the credit card verification process entails. Also, without the need to share payment information, I felt less threatened by unexpected charges.</del></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Verification and Validation" src="/assets/images/oci-signup-verification-ccf51937b623e75cf5d66306d9b69295.jpg" width="1041" height="710" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I had to start a new trial, and went through the process of verifying my contact number and provided a credit card for validation. It wasn't hard to do with the code received in a few seconds and adding a payment method was instantaneous of course.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Wait Begins" src="/assets/images/oci-creation-pause-305c7d4bd90fe1ce391a44ac31c9344d.png" width="1218" height="805" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I did receive the welcome email within the estimated time and was pleasantly surprised as I have heard stories about how long it takes just to get the cloud account credentials and begin burning credits.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Credentials" src="/assets/images/oci-signup-complete-email-0c1698dfdd18383907f7276aeb86068c.jpg" width="1128" height="941" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I opted to use the account URL provided to me on the sign up page to begin. This URL is based on the Cloud Account Name (or tenancy as I know it) and is in the format: <code>https://myservices-&lt;CLOUD ACCOUNT_NAME&gt;.console.oraclecloud.com</code>.</p><p>Since I was signing in for the first time, I was expected to set a new password that complied with the set of rules, conveniently printed on the side.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Set a Secure Password" src="/assets/images/oci-one-time-password-5b3e66ae007ee076bd0a78a2e05b0ada.png" width="1183" height="596" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once that was done, I was redirected to the "My Services Dashboard" that I could customize for a quick overview of services that I was consuming. Nothing yet!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Oracle Cloud - My Services Dashboard" src="/assets/images/oci-landing-page-ab33df39b703e171ff5ce32ce6f68204.png" width="1466" height="833" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p><del>1. How difficult is it to sign up for the service?</del></p></blockquote><p>Overall, the experience was good, bearing in mind that I skipped the credit card verification step(s). Though I had occasional error messages flash on my browser window, they went away after refreshing the page as instructed.</p><p>While I am tempted to go on and create the compute and database resources through the OCI Console, I am compelled to hit a pause and wait till I am done with the workshop later this week, as I have no clue as to how much credits I'll need to complete the exercises and tasks.</p><p>Back in a few days. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>

The scripts were based on the official Docker images <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published by Oracle</a>. With much help from <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin D'Souza</a>, we released the scripts to the community with pointers on how to install and run an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express (APEX)</a> stack.</p><p>While I am proud of the work Martin and I did, it has always been my intention to mothball the project as soon as the team from Oracle released support for 18cXE, which they did about two months ago.</p><p>One of the features of Oracle's images that I discussed with <a href="https://twitter.com/GeraldVenzl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerald Venzl</a>, who happened to be in Vancouver for the <a href="https://bcoug.org/techday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCOUG Tech Day</a> last year, was the <code>setup</code> and <code>startup</code> scripts folder. Any shell or SQL scripts placed in these folders would be automatically executed when the database is created (running the container the first time with no preexisting <code>oradata</code> mounted) and started respectively. The puzzle that needed to be solved was how best to inject the necessary files and code for installing and running APEX and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)</a>.</p><p>I think I have something figured out and have placed the scripts I used in this <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/docker-apex-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>. It includes a three-step formula that will:</p><ol><li>Grab the latest code from Oracle's repository, but only keep the important pieces for this to work.</li><li>Build the image; and then</li><li>Run the container.</li></ol><p>Detailed instructions are found in the repository. Please post questions under "Issues" if you need help and I'll do my best to respond as soon as I can.</p><p>Hope you have as much fun as I did trying to get all this to work!</p>]]></content:encoded>

It was one of the rare TV serials that my wife and I shared a common interest in. I think this was mostly because the first season was centered around the ship and its crew's fight against total human annihilation by an infectious disease. For me though, it was also about the military hardware and camaraderie amongst the soldiers.</p><p>In the second season, Tom Chandler, the hero captain of the USS Nathan James, gave a teenager, Ray Diaz, a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenge coin</a> when they were first introduced. It was a goodwill gesture between "leaders" and demonstrated his desire for unity between the navy officers and a band of teenage bounty hunters.</p><p>From what I have read, challenge coins are usually given out by military unit commanders, sometimes in recognition of a member's contribution to the unit. Bearers carry them with a sense of pride and belonging, and can be used in "challenges" where the goal was free beer! There are variations to how this might be played, but that's not why I decided to create an <strong>APEX Challenge Coin</strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="APEX Challenge Coins" src="/assets/images/apex-challenge-coin_1280x720-2bb9951ab6e932fa7e65edc432b106b0.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That's right! I designed and minted coins for exemplary <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) Developers like YOU!</p><p>A few years ago, I had made something very similar and gave them out at various events and presentations I did at <a href="https://kscope19.odtug.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kscope</a>. They were available in four colours, printed with 3D printers, and worked great as key chains or luggage tags.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="3D-printed #orclapex tags" src="/assets/images/3d-printed-tags-2e65b096920c045bff9f6df07824dbbf.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To preserve the spirit and significance of a challenge coin, I have decided that these will have to be earned. To receive one, you must:</p><ol><li>Be an APEX Developer (duh!).</li><li>Have performed exceedingly well in your professional career and/or contributed significantly to the community or an individual.</li><li>Know someone who thinks you have met both requirements (1) and (2).</li></ol><p>Like every APEX developer, each coin is unique and comes with a serial number. It sits comfortably in a tough PVC bag to protect the surface and paint from damage. If you know someone who is deserving and would like to give this person one to say a special thank you, then please reach out to me via <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzziebrain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. There are costs, and as supplies are very limited, each person may only request a maximum of five coins.</p><p>For those who will earn this coin, my advanced congratulations! You make us, the community, very proud!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Added a help utility to populate an Oracle Wallet with root certificates</p></blockquote><p>Oracle Database 18c Express Edition comes with a usable Oracle Wallet. In a previous <a href="/content/id/1720">article</a>, I had described how to:</p><ol><li>Obtain the certificates necessary to make a successful SSL/TLS connection.</li><li>Create and add these certificates to the Oracle Wallet.</li><li>Configure the APEX instance to use the wallet.</li></ol><p>Someone had asked in the comments, what certificates were necessary for Social Sign-in in <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) to work. It's something that I think most of us would like to know too, so I did a little more digging and here's what I found for three of the more popular social platforms: Google, Facebook and Microsoft.</p><p>Fortunately, the discovery I did for another previous <a href="/content/id/1711">work</a> on circumventing wallet issues helped in determining which URLs were called by the authentication workflow. To add a Generic OAuth2 Provider, three of these are required: Authorization, Token and User Info endpoints. </p><p>When the authentication process begins, the user is first redirected to the Authorization endpoint and that interaction is performed through the browser. Upon successful authentication, the Identity Provider (IdP) then calls the APEX authentication callback URL with the necessary parameters. APEX calls the Token and User Info to obtain an access token and user information respectively. These are made through the APEX_WEB_SERVICE APIs and hence, the certificates for these two endpoints will be required. Here they are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>IdP</th><th>Endpoint</th><th>URL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google</td><td>Token</td><td><a href="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>User Info</td><td><a href="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo</a></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook<sup>*</sup></td><td>Token</td><td><a href="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/oauth/access_token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/oauth/access_token</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>User Info</td><td><a href="https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/me</a></td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>Token</td><td><a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>User Info</td><td><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me</a></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><sup>*</sup> Based on the findings of [Dimitri Gielis](https://twitter.com/dgielis) in this comprehensive [blog post](http://dgielis.blogspot.com/2018/06/facebook-google-and-custom.html)</blockquote><p>Using the OpenSSL client, we can obtain the necessary certificates like we did <a href="/content/id/1720">before</a>. However, I'd like to highlight an important issue that I had missed in the previous post, and that is how to obtain the <strong>root certificates</strong>.</p><p>During the <a href="https://knowledge.digicert.com/solution/SO16297.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate validation process</a>, the full chain is needed to verify and trust the server certificate presented by the web service. Servers however, are not required to include the root certificate. Clients are expected to have those in the trust store and in fact, should ignore any root certificates that a server might send over the channel. Hence, when we attempted to retrieve the certificates for import into the Oracle Wallet, only the server and intermediate certificates were returned.</p><p>By importing only the intermediate certificates though, it looks like there's an implicit trust that the certificates were correctly signed and will validate even if you do not have the root certificates in the wallet. Always download these intermediate certificates with eyes wide open. The OpenSSL client does attempt to verify the certificates, so keep a look out for a message like this:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$ openssl s_client -connect sha1-intermediate.badssl.com:443 -showcerts</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">..</span><span class="token plain">.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">---</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">SSL handshake has </span><span class="token builtin class-name">read</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1938</span><span class="token plain"> bytes and written </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">302</span><span class="token plain"> bytes</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Verification error: unable to verify the first certificate</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">---</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">..</span><span class="token plain">.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Or towards the end:</p><div class="language-plaintext codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-plaintext codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Assuming that these web services always transmit all the intermediate certificates, then we could reduce the amount of work by adding the root certificates to complete the trust chain.

Adding all the root certificates in this file will probably allow access to nearly every legitimate and secure web service on the planet.

This was done primarily through <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> packages and exposed as RESTful Web Services. Not the ideal solution, but useful for people wanting to integrate R statistical calculations and complex charting, but could not afford the hefty price tag for an Oracle Database Enterprice Edition license, plus the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-analytics/overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Advanced Analytics</a> database option.</p><p>The revolutionary 18c release of the <a href="https://oracle.com/xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Express Edition</a> (XE) significantly changed the Data Analytics playing field. The no-cost platform has resource caps (2 CPU, 2 GB RAM and 12 GB data storage). It's not going to help perform complex <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GWAS</a> (Genome-wide Association Study), but should suffice for many smaller research projects, statistical reporting and creating useful prediction models.</p><p>Unfortunately, the XE website has only a single line that says anything about this cool feature of the database:</p><blockquote><p>If you prefer R programming, Oracle Database supports that too.</p></blockquote><p>How do we get started?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-docker-project-for-ore">A Docker Project for ORE<a class="hash-link" href="#a-docker-project-for-ore" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E83411_01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) Documentation</a> provides quite a lot of information on what's involved and how to setup a ORE environment. However, looking at what's installed in XE, it looks like the server components have already been installed (see <code>$(ORACLE_HOME/R)</code>). And if you attempted a silent ORE server install, the script complains about how a later version has already been installed and would not proceed.</p><p>I took it upon myself to waddle through the mud and figure out what's involved to get ORE going on my workstation. The end result was a suite of scripts and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dockerfile</a> for creating an ORE server and client for running R. These have been published in this public <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/docker-oracle-ore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repository</a>. </p><p><strong>NOTE</strong> that this environment is meant for an explorer to bash quickly through the undergrowth, and head right into some interesting R and APEX coding.

However, it is important to remember that <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/asoag/introduction-to-transparent-data-encryption.html#GUID-769EC29B-0107-40FE-9A9D-BF81A4BBD0E9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transparent Data Encryption</a> (TDE) protects your data from bad actors, who might have illegally gained access to the data files. Data exists unencrypted when loaded and accessed in the database. Malicious attacks can come from internal sources as well. When storing user confidential information, data stewards need to take greater responsibility in ensuring that data is only seen by staff who are authorized and require access to privileged information. That could mean creating tiered access and other protections like data redaction.</p><p>For example, an e-commerce website that handles credit card transactions, may require call centre staff to have access to the last four digits of a credit card number for verifying customers' identity when support call are received. Or an insurance claims website that requires claimants to submit their health identity number. The application displays the partially or fully-masked ID, enough to suggest that the data has been captured, but insufficient for a passerby to steal a glance.</p><p>Oracle's Data Redaction makes this possible, and with the latest release of <a href="https://oracle.com/xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database 18c Express Edition</a>, this technology is now <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/xelic/licensing-information.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acessible</a> to developers for <strong>FREE</strong>!

The credit card numbers are successfully masked. However, there are some key concerns with this approach. When implementing security for applications and system, I generally subscribe to a few "golden rules".</p><ol><li>Avoid reinventing the wheel - the same is said with data encrypting methods. It's always preferred that we apply commonly used, well-tested and accepted algorithms. There are many credit card options. Designing a comprehensive regular expression or string replacement scheme to cover all the available number formats is not easy. Why not rely on off-the-shelf solutions from companies that have invested significantly and has a lot of experience dealing with these issues, for handling these monumental and critical tasks.</li><li>Separation of duties - if developers have no need to view the data of the applications they build, then perhaps they should not. Creating data security policies and enforcement should preferably be the responsibility of a separate person or team.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oracles-gift">Oracle's Gift<a class="hash-link" href="#oracles-gift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When Oracle Database 12c was released, the company restructured its Advanced Security Option offering. Secure database connections became a "feature" and a new technology, Data Redaction, was introduced and became part of the for-fee product. We, Oracle Database Developers, are very fortunate that this premium functionality is now available for free with the Oracle Database 18c XE.</p><p>With Data Redaction, I am relying on Oracle's vast experiences implementing security and compliance with well-known, well-defined security requirements. It offers predefined redaction rules that not only mask credit card numbers, but national identification numbers, phone numbers, email addresses and even IP addresses.</p><p>Redaction policies are created at the "database level", so that means they apply regardless of how you access the data. Running a query in SQL Developer, SQLcl or through an APEX application yields the exact same results.</p><p>As a best practice (separation of duties), Oracle encourages customers to use a different user/role for managing redaction policies. Let's begin by creating a user <code>sec_admin</code> for this task. We note the following requirements for creating such a user (from the docs):</p><blockquote><ul><li>To create redaction policies, you must have the EXECUTE privilege on the DBMS_REDACT PL/SQL package.</li><li>You do not need any privileges to access the underlying tables or views that will be protected by the policy.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Let's do that. As <code>SYS</code> user, execute the following commands:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

Applications do not require explicit coding to encrypt data for storage. TDE manages encryption during storage, and decryption when data is read, transparently and automatically.</p><p>TDE can also be used during backups. In the typical "<em>tape falls off the back of the truck</em>" scenario, malicious actors would not be able to decipher the data on the lost tapes without the crucial encryption key stored in the Oracle Wallet. Assuming of course, the wallet was not backed up to the same tape.</p><p>This enterprise-grade feature is found in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/advanced-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Advanced Security</a> Database Option. That requires user to be licensed for database enterprise edition. However, with <a href="https://oracle.com/xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database 18c Express Edition</a> (18cXE), Oracle has made it free and accessible by everyone!</p><p>This post was specially written for <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) developers who are new to this technology. It provides a simple workflow for creating an encrypted tablespaces. Since APEX application live on the database, placing the parsing schema on a TDE-enabled tablespace, automatically protects the entire application.

Please read this follow-up <a href="/content/id/1725">post</a> as well. It contains an important note about intermediate certificates and where to download the root certificates.</p></blockquote><p>One of the difficulties working with web services in the previous version of Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) was the lack of a usable Oracle Wallet. This was fast becoming a huge problems for developers, as many API providers started enforcing requirements to that clients accessed services through secured channels. When working with 11g XE, I often relied on proxies within a sandbox to mask the need for SSL/TLS. I discussed this somewhat at length in a previous <a href="/content/id/1711">blog post</a>.</p><p>With the 18c release, Oracle has opened up and provided us developers the opportunities to make our apps safer. We now have access to the (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/dbseg/using-the-orapki-utility-to-manage-pki-elements.html#GUID-83EF7865-373A-4C39-8A64-44A73EB87759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>orapki</code></a>) tools needed to manage an Oracle Wallet. I don't do this a lot, so I keep a snippets of what I do to make this easy.</p><p>I had to revisit this procedure while configuring <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) to support email sending using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.2/AEAPI/APEX_MAIL.htm#AEAPI341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>APEX_MAIL</code></a> package. The target SMTP server is Google's <code>smtp.google.com</code>, and because we want to secure the user credentials during authentication, we have to use TLS. We will use this for context.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="obtain-root-and-intermediate-certificates">Obtain Root and Intermediate Certificates<a class="hash-link"

ICYMI, the next-generation Oracle Database 18c Express Edition (18cXE) was released late last week. The database software comes with a bunch of free enterprise features and options that usually come with a hefty price tag. Among them, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/advanced-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Advanced Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/advanced-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Advanced Security</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/spatialandgraph/documentation/documentation-087054.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle RDF Semantic Graph</a> are my favourites! See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/xelic/licensing-information.html#GUID-9D776CC6-7154-488B-A2D4-638534A6A66B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Features Availability</a> for more details on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle</a> great giveaway!</p><p>Since Saturday, I have been kept busy working on getting the development environment ready for <a href="https://forallabeautiful.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabe</a>. It was just weeks ago since we had the environment up and running on 11gXE. The instance is fully driven on the back of <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> that made it easier to swap out the database.</p><p>I couldn't wait for <a href="https://twitter.com/GeraldVenzl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerald Venzi</a> and his team to publish the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Docker images</a> for 18cXE, so I went ahead to create my own. My working files are <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/docker-oracle-xe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> on GitHub and is somewhat based on their excellent work. <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin D'Souza</a> has since also contributed some few "minor" changes.</p><p>Do note however, that I highly recommend using the official images instead, as soon as they are released. Another caution is that data files and database configuration persistance have not been implemented. Dropping your container will likely cause complete data loss. You have been warned.</p><p>I followed the "<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/xeinl/exporting-and-importing-data-apex-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exporting and Importing Data for Oracle Application Express (APEX) Users</a>" procedure to move data between the two database versions. The process was simple and straight-forward, but I was nervous nonetheless. The following are some additional notes that I thought might be useful to fellow <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> developers.</p><p>Before launching the new 18cXE container, I performed a data dump using Oracle's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/sutil/oracle-data-pump.html#GUID-501A9908-BCC5-434C-8853-9A6096766B5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Pump</a> utility. The existing 11gXE container was then dropped. Prudence would have insisted that I left the container running, but I wanted to reuse the container name, so I had it blown away. The original container was created using the official Docker images and a host directory was mounted to the container as <code>/u01/app/oracle/oradata</code>, keeping the data and configuration files safe, so I had very little concerns deciding to delete the container once the data dump was done.</p><p>For convenience, I had set the <code>DUMP_DIR</code> to <code>/u01/app/oracle/oradata/export</code>, ensuring access after the 11gXE container had gone away. Then comes the fun part: building and running the brand new 18cXE Docker container. It took a few minutes, but was otherwise a very smooth process.</p><p>Once the database was up and running, the next thing to do is to perform the data dump import process. Using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>docker cp</code></a> (copy) command, I uploaded the dump file to the container's <code>/opt/oracle/oradata/export</code>. After that, I used the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>docker exec</code></a> to get a Bash session. Once inside, I changed the ownership of the dump file: <code>chown oracle.oinstall /opt/oracle/oradata/export/db11g.dmp</code>.</p><p>With everything in place, I switched to the oracle user (<code>su - oracle</code>), <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/xeinl/setting-oracle-database-xe-environment-variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set the environment variables</a> (<code>. oraenv</code>) and then proceeded to use <code>impdp</code> to import the data. Make sure that the <code>REMAP_DIRECTORY</code> parameter was duly added as the default <code>ORACLE_BASE</code> path is different between 11g and 18c. It was rather unnerving as I was seeing a lot more errors than what was listed in the documentation that could be safely ignored. Thankfully, the process appeared to have completed successfully.</p><p>Running <code>apxfix.sql</code> was a first for me. APEX had already been updated to 18.2 in the previous 11gXE container and so I executed the following command in SQL*Plus: <code>apxfix.sql APEX_180200</code>. Felt like an APEX patching/upgrade process, but I'm sure there was a little more to it. It didn't take very long to complete and to my relief, it was error free. From here, I skipped over the next two steps in the documentation as I had APEX already configured to use <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services</a> (ORDS). The last prescribed step was to unlock the <code>ANONYMOUS</code> account in the CDB.</p><p>Beyond what was documented, here are a few other steps needed to get the APEX instance up and running successfully:</p><ol><li>For the ORDS configuration, the <code>db.sid</code> parameter in <code>&lt;CONFIG_DIR&gt;/ords/defaults.xml</code> was replaced with <code>db.servicename</code> and set to <code>XEPDB1</code>, the PDB created by default during the database configuration process.</li><li>Update the network access control lists (ACL) using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.2/HTMIG/enabling-network-services-in-Oracle-db11g-or-later.htm#GUID-8D125731-989A-4A51-AFFE-00181729F87F" target="_blank" rel="noopener

switching steps (<code>alter session set container=XEPDB1;</code>) in the migration documentation. It takes a little effort to learn the new concepts, but the knowledge and experience are essential as non-CDB databases will soon be history. From now on, your work happens in a pluggable database (PDB) and will pretty much leave the container database (CDB) alone.

            <description><![CDATA[1280 720 The Great Wall of China]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="1280 720 The Great Wall of China" src="/assets/images/china-2097075_1280x720-3b0d33b35a0d3974025744eab9ecf129.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Authentication is an essential component of any enterprise application. These days though, it isn't enough to protect your applications with only a username and password. These are easily stolen by key loggers, sniffing non-encrypted HTTP traffic, phishing, hacked Internet services and the list goes on. To make matters worse, many users have a poor habit of reusing passwords that thieves then use to penetrate other systems. I have had my fair share of that experience.</p><p>The question is, can we implement <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-factor authentication</a> (TFA) in <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX)?</p><p><strong>Yes we can!</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-code">The Code<a class="hash-link" href="#the-code" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Right around the time when I grew interested in implementing the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-based One-time Password</a> (TOTP) algorithm, I stumbled upon <a href="https://community.oracle.com/thread/3905510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a> written by Rabbit on the Oracle Community Forums, only months earlier. Hurrah! I didn't have to deal with the mathematical intricacies of implementing the algorithm in PL/SQL code.</p><p>After discussing with <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin D'Souza</a>, we decided that the best way to share this useful algorithm was through OraOpenSource <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oos-utils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oos-utils</a>. All it needed was some additional functionality to make it useful for implementing a custom authentication scheme with TFA support in APEX. We also swapped out the <code>dbms_crypto</code> requirement and used <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonScheffer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anton Scheffer's</a> <code>oos_util_crypto</code> library to perform the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMAC</a> hashing instead. This means, the code should be usable in your workspace on <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.oracle.com</a>.</p><p>What was missing in the release though, was a demo application to showcase its use, so two years later, here it is!</p><ul><li>{% fa globe %} <a href="https://apeks.app/ords/f?p=TFADEMO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demo application</a></li><li>{% fa git %} <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/orclapex-tfa-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source code</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="highlights">Highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#highlights" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The following are a few key points about the implementation that I thought might be of interest.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="registration">Registration<a class="hash-link" href="#registration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The registration does not automatically "turn on" TFA for new accounts. The new user is expected to login to the system and activate the TFA protection. During registration, a random and unique key was generated for the account. Whenever TFA is activated, a QR code is generated using the function <code>oos_util_totp.format_key_uri</code>, user's "shared secret" and a suitable, trusted QR code generation JavaScript library. This allows the user to setup the security application and generate one-time passwords (OTP). The user must validate a OTP before the feature is enabled for the account.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="authentication">Authentication<a class="hash-link" href="#authentication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The authentication process will allow users to authenticate with or without OTP validation depending on the user's preference. The original (default) login page 9999 was modified to support both authentication workflows.</p><p>The <code>Login</code> process typically calls <code>apex_authentication.login</code> that triggers a sequence of events <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.2/AEAPI/LOGIN-Procedure.htm#AEAPI29157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed</a> in the official APEX documentation. The process calls an authentication function that matches usernames and passwords. If the function returns true, then the APEX engine will, in a nutshell, set the username for the session and redirect to the requested resource. This function call was replaced with a procedure, <code>pkg_tfa_apex.p_authenticate_user</code>.</p><div class="language-plsql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-plsql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">if l_password_hash = f_hash_password(p_password =&gt; p_password) then</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  if l_tfa_enabled = 0 then</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    apex_authentication.post_login(</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">      p_username =&gt; p_username</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">      , p_password =&gt; null</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    );</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    apex_util.clear_page_cache();</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  end if;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">else</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  raise login_failed;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">end if;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>If TFA is <strong>not</strong> enabled, then <code>apex_authentication.post_login</code> is called. We have already established that the username and password are correct, so this allows us to bypass the first two steps in a typical authentication sequence.</p><p>Usually, the default login page has a final process that clears the session state for the page, but that was removed. A branch to a second-step login page (10000) was added. It passes the username entered on page 9999 to the the next page for OTP validation. The username is used to retrieve the user's shared secret that is is required by <code>oos_util_totp.validate_otp</code>. Hence, I opted to call <code>apex_util.clear_page_cache</code> only if TFA was turned off.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="otp-validation">OTP Validation<a class="hash-link" href="#otp-validation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The login process redirects to a second login page that requires the user to enter the OTP from a "registered" security app. This is verified (must match with what the system generates) using a page validation. If that checks out, then we will proceed to call the <code>apex_authentication.post_login</code> procedure and complete the login process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing">Closing<a class="hash-link" href="#closing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As always, security is an important issue in any software application we build.

By now, I believe most would have heard that OMM has been deprecated. <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeDietrichDE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Dietrich</a> made special mention of it in a <a href="https://mikedietrichde.com/2018/08/10/oracle-multimedia-is-deprecated-in-oracle-18c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> earlier this year, with some clarity as to exactly when we can expect to see this useful feature go away for good.</p><p>As Mike pointed out, we can anticipate that OMM will be completely removed from Oracle Database 19c, and that's scheduled to be in January 2019 or perhaps even earlier <a href="http://www.dbta.com/Editorial/News-Flashes/Larry-Ellison-Previews-Roadmap-to-Oracle-Database-Version-19c-126774.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> the man who knows.</p><blockquote><p>"Oracle recommends that you store multimedia content in SecureFiles LOBs, and use open source or third-party products for image processing and conversion."</p><cite>-- <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/upgrd/terminal-release-oracle-multimedia.html#GUID-DBA90E57-2BD8-4CEE-A74B-BFC889B78057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Upgrade Guide - Terminal Release of Oracle Multimedia</a></cite></blockquote><p>At Kscope17, I spoke about using OMM and various other techniques to capture and manipulate images with <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a>. The demo application I wrote and deployed on <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.oracle.com</a>, ran without issues. It included functionality that used OMM PL/SQL APIs to perform simple image processing tasks like thumbnail generation and applying watermarks to uploaded photos. Months later, the code stopped working (though it does now), and I remembered having conversations about this issue that eventually lead to the understanding that OMM was going away.</p><p>Going forward, what are our alternatives? Perhaps a discussion for another day. For now, a <strong>BIG THANK YOU</strong> to the brilliant minds at Oracle who brought us Oracle Mutlimedia a.k.a. Oracle interMedia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

For those of who attend either in-person or the follow-up webinar, you might recall I briefly talked about image recognition and how they can be integrated with an <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> solution using third-party JavaScript libraries.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shape-detection-api">Shape Detection API<a class="hash-link" href="#shape-detection-api" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Google has submitted a draft of the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape Detection API</a> specification for consideration as a standard under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a>. These experimental APIs will be available as an experimental feature from Chrome 70 (see the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/chrome-70-beta-shape-detection-web.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a>).</p><p>The following will be available under this specification:</p><ul><li>Face Detection</li><li>Barcode Detection</li><li>Text Detection</li></ul><p>These APIs are very promising and easy to use. Both barcode and text detection returns the raw value, which you can then use to store in the database. Imagine the implications.</p><p>I am very excited, and have created a <a href="https://apeks.app/ords/f?p=126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo application</a> to try them out. Remember, Chrome 70 will be out around mid-October. If you can't wait, then download <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Canary</a>. A mobile device will be required for the barcode detection demo to work.</p><p>Hopefully, this specification will mature quickly and be accepted for implementation in other web browsers. While that's incubating, let's look at another noteworthy API, mentioned in the same blog post.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="web-authentication-api">Web Authentication API<a class="hash-link" href="#web-authentication-api" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The article mentioned some changes and additions including using Mac TouchID and Android fingerprint sensors for authentication. Unlike the Shape Detection API, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAuthn</a> specification is already a candidate recommendation and is supported by current versions of Chrome and Firefox. Microsoft Edge support is currently available under the Windows Insider Program, but should be generally available in October (again), when the 2018 Fall update is released.</p><p>WebAuthn takes away our reliance on vulnerable passwords. Users can use biometrics, a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) or <a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIDO U2F</a> device to securely generate, exchange and verify keys, to gain access to systems. For Windows 10 users, Edge support will include <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/17215/windows-10-what-is-hello" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Hello</a>. Users will be able to authenticate using face or fingerprint recognition.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Just Arrived - FIDO2 Security Key by Yubico" src="/assets/images/fido2-device-33467009eae7ce70166c5f042510cd64.jpg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The specification provides for two workflows: registration and authentication. A device must first be registered with an account before it can be used to perform the authentication workflow. Both workflows are driven by JavaScript on the client-side, but will require server interaction to complete the process. Something that I hope to continue exploring in the coming weeks, if time permits.</p><p>Meanwhile, I believe both Google and Microsoft are working towards supporting WebAuthn for their accounts. With <a href="/content/id/1709">APEX 18c support for OAuth2 authentication</a>, developers can simply rely upon the identity providers to enforce security/login requirements, including the user of WebAuthn devices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The example above is a simple boolean search (<code>AND</code> operator) requiring both the phrase "fossil fuels" and word "environment" for a match. A simple misspelling of "environment" would likely yield no results. That's where other operators like <code>fuzzy</code> provide a margin error, allowing returning results even when there are no exact matches. The same operator might even forgive simple nuances like "colour" versus "color". There are also wildcard (<code>%</code>) and other operators that are denoted using special characters that could sometimes spell trouble even for a seasoned Oracle Text user.</p><p>To protect the untrained user, it is recommended to pre-process the user input and restructure keywords and options into proper query operator constructs. This isn't always easy, and so, we are fortunate that <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/author/roger-ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ford</a>, Oracle Text's Product Manager, posted a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/searchtech/oracle-text-query-parser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> and useful utility package for parsing user inputs from a simple text field. The syntax closely resembles Google's search operators and should be familiar with most users. The code is available to download at the end of Ford's article.</p><p>After compiling the script, functions such as <code>parser.simpleSearch</code> and <code>parser.andSearch</code> will be available to use. Check the comments in the code for details about each function.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SQL</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">select</span><span class="token plain"> parser</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">andsearch</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'"fossil fuels" environment'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">from</span><span class="token plain"> dual</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">-- returns ({fossil fuels}&amp;{environment})</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="querying-with-apex">Querying with APEX<a class="hash-link" href="#querying-with-apex" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With too little screen space on a blog post, it's easier to demonstrate the search results using APEX. The accompanying <a href="https://apeks.app/ords/f?p=awardsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo application</a> showcases Oracle Text integration using two different user interface approaches.</p><p>The first uses Interactive Grids (IG) that has built-in support for Oracle Text.

Go to the application's <code>Shared Components</code>&gt; <code>Component Settings</code> &gt; <code>Interactive Grids</code> and then enter the name of the function to use. We can use one of the functions from Ford's Parser package as they meet the requirement of accepting a single string argument.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Specify a PL/SQL Function for Preprocessing Input String" src="/assets/images/oracle-text-ig-settings-8f008ea773d1ea2414a41e51fbecf0d3.jpg" width="1462" height="821" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The second approach uses a Classic Report (CR) that allows more flexibility on how the results are displayed, for example, sorting the results by score (descending) and application title (ascending). The user enters the search keywords in a single text field page item (<code>P2_SEARCH_TERMS</code>) that is then parsed and used with a <code>CONTAINS</code> operator to query the table.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a flash, it has been almost three years since I left the <a href="https://www.hli.ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre for Heart Lung Innovation</a>, so it's no surprise that a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/OracleAPEX/status/1034395229334523905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> caught my eye and tugged the memory chord. I was introduced to <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) on August 26, 2010. A year (and a major release) later, I had the opportunity to demonstrate it's capabilities with proof that it could help improve productivity in our research centre. As a sidenote, back then, attendees receive DVDs full of developer software goodies. APEX however, didn't need much, just check out the hands-on lab requirements below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Event confirmation email from 2010" src="/assets/images/blast-email-from-the-past-af0bcb3c610e5781f703e6d768129528.jpg" width="556" height="829" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Yup, nothing! All I needed was a laptop, Internet connection and a modern day web browser!</p><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> APEX is a Rapid Application Developer (RAD) platform that is <strong>secure</strong>, <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>extremely flexible</strong> for building web-accessible applications to support research, e.g. data collection forms, surveys, freezer/biospecimen inventory management, laboratory inventory management and many more!</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="research-data-management">Research Data Management<a class="hash-link" href="#research-data-management" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nearly every form of research would involve some form of data collection. As responsible stewards, researchers must ensure data is acquired ethically and accurately, used appropriately, and archived for future validation and reuse. For clinical researchers, rigorous, well-defined data collection methods are even more critical due to the nature and type of data that is collected.</p><p>Clinical research studies that involves human subjects are often governed by Institution Review Boards (IRB). It is the duty of such committees to ensure that the study is ethical and complies with regulatory requirements. That sometimes involves thorough examination of the Data Management Plan (DMP), thereby ensuring that patients'/participants' interests are safeguarded.</p><p>A good Research Data Management (RDM) strategy should consider the following:</p><ul><li>Collection<ul><li>Representation - data structures/schemas</li><li>Storage - #SayNoToSpreadsheets</li><li>Documentation - maintaining an up-to-date data dictionary</li><li>Capture - tools for collecting the data</li></ul></li><li>Maintenance and Compliance<ul><li>Security - storage, access and audits</li><li>Backups</li><li>Disaster Recovery</li><li>Monitoring</li></ul></li><li>Use<ul><li>Access and sharing</li><li>Quality control</li><li>Processing and transformations</li></ul></li><li>Preservation or Destruction</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-apex">Why APEX?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-apex" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One of the more popular software for Electronic Data Capture (EDC) in research is <a href="https://projectredcap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REDCap</a>. The application was first developed and released by <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2004, to provide clinical researchers with a secure data collection tool that met regulatory requirements, and yet not needing users to have extensive technical backgrounds.</p><p>Unfortunately, the software and learning resources are not readily available. To gain access to the application, aspiring REDCap developers must first belong to an institution that is willing to sign up to be a consortium partner. You can however, sign up for a one-week trial account on their demo server.</p><p>To get a sense of how APEX might fit the research environment, I thought it would be fitting to use REDCap's list of <a href="https://projectredcap.org/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software features</a> against what the platform had to offer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>REDCap Feature</th><th>APEX</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Project design (online)</td><td>One of APEX key strengths is its comprehensive, web-based graphical development environment, the App Builder. To get a brief overview of the UI, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_GfZFio9qg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9-minute video</a> from Oracle.</td></tr><tr><td>Project design (offline)</td><td>REDCap allows users to create and edit data collection instruments (forms) using a CSV. Users can modify just about everything including field types, calculation fields and validations. Though APEX applications are declarative and has a rich API, it does not have a matching functionality for creating pages using a configuration file... or do we? Using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/HTMDB/using-blueprints.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application Blueprint</a>, APEX developers can quickly create an application defined in a JSON file. <a href="https://twitter.com/dgielis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimitri Gielis</a> demonstrates how to get this done in this short <a href="https://youtu.be/bccne14Qu10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video tutorial</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Availability</td><td><p>REDCap is available free-of-charge, but as mentioned earlier, you will need to first sign up as an institutional consortium partner.</p><p>APEX is available to download and install at no cost as well. That's right, <strong>no purchase necessary</strong>! Oracle offers a free version of their database. Version 18c and later will even include <a href="https://twitter.com/dgielis/status/1005806235147554816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database features</a> otherwise only available in Enterprise Editions of the software.</p><p>For no-fuss learning and understanding the platform, developers can create a workspace on <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.oracle.com</a>. It's free and the only requirement to keep the "trial" going is to keep using it.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Secure and web-based</td><td><p>APEX runs on top of perhaps the world's most secure database. The Oracle database has built-in features like auditing, secure database connections, cryptographic stored procedures and functions for protecting sensitive information. Other paid options provide additional security features like Transparent Data Encryption, Data Redaction, Fine Grained Auditing (FGA) and much more!</p><p>APEX applications can also be configured to use a wide-variety of authentication methods, including enterprise systems and protocols like LDAP and OAuth2. Single-sign on (SSO) available out-of-the-box.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Fast and flexible</td><td>With APEX, you can develop production-grade, enterprise-ready applications with minimum amount of coding. Users also have at their disposal, tools like <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/quicksql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick SQL</a> and Application Builder for quickly defining data structures and creating applications. Users can also transform spreadsheet data into modern, professional-looking reports and data entry forms in minutes!</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-site access</td><td>Mutli-tenancy support is available at many levels. For example, research groups could isolate their applications and data using APEX workspaces and database schemas. Access can be managed and federated using enterprise identity management systems cited earlier.</td></tr><tr><td>Autonomous utilization</td><td>Administrators within a research groups have full autonomy to manage user/developer accounts and access.</td></tr><tr><td>Fully customizable</td><td>APEX Applications are more than fully customizable. Users/developers can modify the look-and-feel (Themes) and behaviour (Dynamic Actions and Processes). For advanced developers, the sky's the limit!</td></tr><tr><td>Audit trails</td><td>The Oracle Database provides standard auditing features. Enterprise Edition customers have the option to also enable FGA.</td></tr><tr><td>Automated export procedures</td><td>The Data Workshop utility in APEX provides the ability to import and export data in XML and CSV formats. Developers can also write PL/SQL routines to generate the data in a suitable download format. Packaged as an APEX plugin, these procedures are then readily reusable in other applications. For example, Didier Bastogne created a Process Type <a href="http://www.apex-plugin.com/oracle-apex-plugins/process-type-plugin/download-sdf_388.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugin</a> that allows users to download a table of molecules in SDF file format.</td></tr><tr><td>A built-in project calendar</td><td>APEX comes with a comprehensive Team Development utility that allows developers to work together. Developers can set milestones, define features, track TODO items, file bugs and manage feedback, all within the workspace environment.</td></tr><tr><td>A scheduling module</td><td>This module is specially geared to help with longitudinal studies. Since APEX is a multi-purpose application development platform, such modules do not exist. Developers will have to create scheduling features within a clinical research application.</td></tr><tr><td>Ad hoc reporting tools</td><td>User-driven reporting is one of APEX's greatest strengths. There is too much to write about Interactive Reports (IR) and Interactive Grids (IG) to condense in a single blog post. Suffice to say that with IRs and IGs, users can filter, sort, create computations and aggregations, and generate charts, all without developer intervention.</td></tr><tr><td>Branching logic</td><td>Dynamic actions and page branching in APEX provides developers declaratively define the application's business logic.</td></tr><tr><td>File uploading</td><td>The Data Load utility described earlier, facilitates the import of data into the system. Developers may also use the File Browse page item to allow users to submit files for upload. Files can be staged and manipulated in the database before it is finally stored. APEX also has a wizard to create a data-loading wizard that allows users to upload, map and import delimited data files.</td></tr><tr><td>Calculated fields</td><td>Use Dynamic Actions to perform on-the-fly calculations using either JavaScript, PL/SQL or both.</td></tr><tr><td>A quick and easy software installation process</td><td>Installing the APEX software stack is more involved and probably requires a steeper learning curve. However, with modern DevOps tools available and a lot of helpful fellow developers, there are now <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker images</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-boxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagrant configuration files</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/OXAR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build scripts</a> to help setup the stack with minimal user interaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory compliance</td><td>The platform itself may not been certified with regulatory authorities, however, infrastructure providers could architect and have their systems validated.</td></tr><tr><td>Available in multiple languages</td><td>Multiple languages are <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/HTMDB/understanding-application-translation-and-globalization-support.htm#HTMDB14001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a>. <a href="http://translate-apex.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community-contributed translation</a> text are also available freely for download and use.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features-of-note">Features of Note<a class="hash-link" href="#features-of-note" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The following are three features that makes it even more compelling to take a deeper look at APEX.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enterprise-ready-authentication-schemes">Enterprise-ready Authentication Schemes<a class="hash-link" href="#enterprise-ready-authentication-schemes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Available since version 4.0</p></blockquote><p>The Social Sign In authentication scheme, made available with the 18.1 release, is my favourite. To me, an important consideration when introducing new software or platforms, is its ability to integrate with existing systems, most importantly, security. Let's face it, users do a poor job in maintaining their account credentials and so, the less username-password combos they need to come up with, the better. A SSO setup also allows administrators to introduce more secure policies like requiring the use of two-factor authentication during logins.</p><p>The new authentication scheme comes pre-configured to work with Google and Facebook's OAuth2 providers. I have written previously on <a href="/content/id/1709">how to do this</a>. All you need are the correct URLs to use. No coding required. There are two additional setups for OpenID and generic OAuth2 providers like Microsoft.</p><p>Besides OAuth2, APEX has supported LDAP and HTTP Header Variable authentication for a while now. I have also written about how SSO can be <a href="https://insum.ca/saml2-single-sign-on-with-oracle-application-express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">achieved with SAML2</a>, making it possible for users to seamlessly move between Google G Suite/Microsoft Office 365 environments and corporate APEX applications.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quick-sql">Quick SQL<a class="hash-link" href="#quick-sql" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Available since version 5.1</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/quicksql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick SQL</a> was first made available in APEX 5.1 as a packaged application. Packaged applications are fully functional applications that you can install in APEX workspaces. These applications come pre-packed with installation scripts and seed data. I digress. When version 18.1 was released, Quick SQL became a feature and is accessed during the process of creating a new application or through the SQL Scripts utility.</p><p>Using syntax similar to Markdown, users/developers can use a shorthand to script out a data model and then generate the SQL code needed to create these database objects.</p><p>Here's a quick example:</p><div class="language-markdown

class="hash-link" href="#web-source-modules" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Available since version 18.1</p></blockquote><p>APEX has had PL/SQL packages (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/AEAPI/APEX_WEB_SERVICE.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>apex_web_service</code></a>) to work with external REST APIs for a while now, but the new <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/HTMDB/managing-web-source-modules.htm#HTMDB-GUID-93D7A596-03A9-48AF-9FC9-6538BCC25DED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Source Modules</a> (WSM) feature found in version 18.1 is a game-changer. Power users and developers configure credentials and WSM references with simply the knowledge of what URLs and parameters to use. Once created, reports can be created using these WSMs as source. The framework performs any necessary authentication, REST calls, result parsing and then renders them as though they were database tables or views.</p><p>This feature allows developers to easily integrate and interact with external data available through REST APIs, e.g. <a href="http://data.bioontology.org/documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bioontology</a> and <a href="https://developer.mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailChimp</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-missing">What's Missing<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-missing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>APEX is great, but it's a general purpose tool. One that we can use to create and support a wide variety of business use cases. As a platform for supporting research, here are some areas where it falls a <strong>little</strong> short. And I emphasised "little" because there are workarounds.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="validated-instruments">Validated Instruments<a class="hash-link" href="#validated-instruments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>REDCap maintains a <a href="https://projectredcap.org/resources/library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">library/collection</a> of validated data collection instruments. These are pre-baked forms and data structures that have been used in research and peer reviewed in publications. Researchers could use these and avoid reinventing the wheel.</p><p>We don't have access to such a resource for APEX <strong>yet</strong>. However, with Package Applications, I am confident that a similar repository of research-focused package apps could be made available to the community. If this interests you, then ping me. Let's talk.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="de-identification">De-identification<a class="hash-link" href="#de-identification" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Designed for clinical research, the REDCap Consortium has put much effort in ensuring that the software meets regulatory compliance and patient privacy is protected. Hence, you will find built-in data de-identification tools and are commonly used during data exports. APEX does not facilitate de-identification out-of-the-box. While developers can implement filters that can do the same during data exports, the preferred approach is to use features such as Data Redaction and Data Masking. These unfortunately, are paid options on top of the Enterprise Edition of the database.</p><p>Below is an organic list of academic institutions that I have identified through various sources, that use APEX for research, provide an APEX platform and/or services to support research. A few institutions actively use APEX administratively, but to keep the discussion in context, I opted to leave them out for now. They are however, primed to deliver APEX services for the research activities, if any, within their organization.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Institution/Organization</th><th>Country</th><th>Source</th><th>Date Added</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://www.hli.ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre for Heart Lung Innovation</a></td><td>Canada</td><td>Personal knowledge</td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bcchr.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a></td><td>Canada</td><td>Personal knowledge</td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.cfenet.ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BC Centre for Excellence</a></td><td>Canada</td><td><a href="http://www.cfenet.ubc.ca/join-us/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job posting</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td>Indiana University</td><td>United States</td><td><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/367029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Press release</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://case.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case Western Reserve University</a></td><td>United States</td><td><a href="https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/research-database-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource listing</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.icompbio.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Computer Biology</a></td><td>United States</td><td><a href="http://www.icompbio.net/oracle-apex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource listing</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Ames Research Center</a></td><td>United States</td><td><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation/Publication</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.csiro.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a></td><td>Australia</td><td><a href="https://research.csiro.au/oa-idc/web-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource listing</a></td><td>2018-09-03</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Google searches only take you that far, so this is by no means a comprehensive lay of the land.

In reality, many institutions have a site licenses and/or significant discounts for using the Oracle Database. If you are endowed with such resources, please reach out to the IT folks and do the right thing. Stop storing and hording data on spreadsheets and file-based, siloed relational databases. Secure them in enterprise-grade software and take data collection to the next level with advanced, web-based forms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

To setup my working environment, I decided to deploy an Oracle Database instance using the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker images</a> that Oracle has also open sourced previously. However, during that process, I encountered the dreaded:</p><p>{% codeblock lang:plain line_number:false %}

checkSpace.sh: The container needs at least 15 GB, but only 4 GB are available.

A quick check on the filesystem quickly revealed what the root problem was: <strong>free disk space</strong>!</p><p>{% codeblock lang:bash line_number:false %}

Here's the customary post-Kscope article. This year though, is one Kscope to remember! Along with other <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) community members, I had the surprise honour of joining the ranks of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oracle-ace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle ACE Program</a>. And so I wanted to start off by first thanking newly-minted Oracle ACE Director <a href="https://twitter.com/opal_EPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opal Alapat</a>. Last year, I had deep suspicions that she was responsible for my ODTUG Volunteer Award. Then came the ACE Associate nomination.</p><blockquote><p>Opal, if you are reading this: <strong>THANK YOU</strong>!</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="content-and-events">Content and Events<a class="hash-link" href="#content-and-events" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I was a little late getting to the conference again this year. I opted for a red-eye that took me from Vancouver to Orlando via Toronto, and arrived after the first Sunday Symposium. Unfortunately, I missed out on important news regarding the impending Oracle XE 18c release slated for August 2018. Thankfully, my watch buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverLemm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Lemm</a> captured and tweeted this slide that detailed the features of 2018's most-anticipated database.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some keyfacts about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oraclexe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oraclexe</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mikehichwa1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kscope18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#kscope18</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/orclapex?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#orclapex</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oracle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oracle</a> <a href="https://t.co/iqAX08ac7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/iqAX08ac7A</a></p>— Oliver Lemm (@OliverLemm) <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverLemm/status/1005805541086593025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2018</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>If you asked me, that's a delicious bait that anyone would swallow whole, hook and all!</p><p>There were other key announcements made during <a href="https://twitter.com/joelkallman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Kallman</a>'s "State of the Union" address:</p><ul><li><a href="https://apex.oracle.com/officehours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APEX Office Hours</a></li><li>Updated APEX Certification; and</li><li>APEX MOOC</li></ul><p>More importantly though, my dear friend <a href="https://twitter.com/JuergenSchuster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juergen Schuster</a> was finally given the recognition he deserved!

Apart from quiet times to psych and prep myself, I felt a need to be talking to people both at and away from the booth. For those sessions that I wanted to attend, there were always conflicts and decisions to be made until I can master the art of bilocation. Here are the ones that I did manage to attend this year:</p><ul><li>Introduction to Hyperledger</li><li>JavaScript and Offline First</li><li>Exploring the Details of APEX Sessions</li><li>Cross Workspace Application Authentication Using JSON Web Tokens</li><li>Emerging Tech Unconference Session</li><li>Automatically Deploy Schema Changes with Ansible and Liquibase</li><li>Developing Secure Applications</li><li>Deep Dive: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetsWreckThisTogether" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LetsWreckThisTogether</a> APEX Talks</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hunting Pokemons During Dimitri Gielis&amp;#39; Emerging Tech Unconference Demo" src="/assets/images/emerging-tech_1280x960-bc73232febef2b9583d107d70f7aea5b.jpg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There were too many sessions that I really wanted to attend, but I guess I'll have to settle for the recordings when they are released later this year.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="presentation">Presentation<a class="hash-link" href="#presentation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="I Am All About APEX and Blockchains" src="/assets/images/presenter-panel_1280x960-963468952fefd8464ae5dddee5105c28.jpg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Blockchains took centre stage at Kscope this year for many reasons. In the past year, we have seen the great surge and grand fall of cryptocurrency prices. The blockchain buzzword appeared in nearly every tech news feed and many were capitalizing on the keyword, me included. Though what I really wanted to do was help APEX developers make sense of the frenzy and access for themselves if learning this emerging tech was a worthwhile pursuit. It is!</p><p>It was great that I was scheduled early this year as it took a big load off my mind. That said, I wondered if the audience would have benefited from first attending the introductory sessions by John King and Emmanuel Abiodun on blockchain and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger</a> respectively. Being on the initial line up, I had to make sure that I covered sufficient basics to provide the needed context for the two demos that I had prepared. Unfortunately, I ran out of time and was not able to do the second demo that involved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and a walkthrough creating a business network using <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/composer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Composer</a>.</p><p>For those who attended my session, thank you and my sincere apologies again for running out of time. Rest assured that I will be blogging more about the topic and demos, so that we can all continue learning and growing. Stay tuned!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="people">People<a class="hash-link" href="#people" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/monty_latiolais" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monty Latiolais</a> tells me that travelling to Kscope for him, is an annual reunion with friends. I agree wholeheartedly. Many of us interact almost exclusively through various Internet channels, and rarely have the chance to meet face-to-face. As a remote worker, this is true even amongst colleagues. Strangely though, you meet people, shake hands and share hugs as though you've known them for ages.</p><p>Congregating at tech conferences are also great opportunities to learn more about our peers outside of our profession. Here are some highlights:</p><ul><li>American politics with Monty</li><li>Canadian politics with <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin D'Souza</a></li><li>Kids 101 and growing up with <a href="https://twitter.com/peppertech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Brock</a>, Martin and <a href="https://twitter.com/dmcghan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan McGhan</a></li></ul><p>Then there are the customers whom you've been on conference calls with. Folks from other tracks, e.g. EPM, who wanted to know more about the APEX magic. The list goes on.</p><p>Thank you everyone, new and old friends, for the wonderful memories and conversations!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-award">The Award<a class="hash-link" href="#the-award" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Badges and Ribbons" src="/assets/images/badge_1280x960-32b127d29fa0f3abe71267cff9ffeb52.jpg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fresh out of university and sucked into the dotcom boom, I attended annual events like Sun Tech Days and Oracle Developer Days in Singapore. I remember how much I had admired and envied Sun Evangelists like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javapassion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sang Shin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukmunnlee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuk-Munn Lee</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/speakjava" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Ritter</a> and many others. They had the best job in the world: learning and toying with new tech and then travelling the globe to share their knowledge. I could only dream!</p><p>Almost twenty years later, I am a little closer to living that dream. Though it isn't a full-time job, receiving the Oracle ACE Associate award, means that I am now obliged to learn more and share more. How cool is that?</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More pics to come.... we love our <a href="https://twitter.com/oracleace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@oracleace</a> members! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kscope18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kscope18</a> <a href="https://t.co/vDXxTVfC9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vDXxTVfC9a</a></p>— Oracle ACE Program (@oracleace) <a href="https://twitter.com/oracleace/status/1006703306037743617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 13, 2018</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I won't deny that I am nervous and feel really small standing amongst giants and some of the brightest minds in the industry.

We had a dedicated sub-topic for JS sessions and the closing Deep Dive session on Thursday was all about getting started and best practices with JS. Should we pay attention as APEX developers? Most definitely yes!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Netscape Navigator - The Old Days" src="/assets/images/Netscape_Navigator_2_Screenshot-6ff8d692c2f6a200d95355254728f027.jpg" width="1117" height="699" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I never liked JS much in the past. Growing up in the industry, it was a "kiddy" scripting language that lacked good structure, standards and compatibility across web browsers. All that has changed. For the last two years, I've been rekindling my interest in JS through learning frameworks and tools such as TypeScript, Angular, Vue.js and Node.js, and will continue to do so.</p><p>Next year, Kscope returns to Seattle and I am very much looking forward to it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Social Media" src="/assets/images/media-998990_1280x720-fd181bfc50177dec0329b70d69254121.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Updated June 4, 2018</strong></p><ul><li>Added settings for social sign-in with Microsoft OAuth2.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The much anticipated <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> version 18.1 was <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/announcing-oracle-apex-181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> on May 24, 2018. Since early this year <a href="https://twitter.com/monty_latiolais" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monty Latiolais</a> has been posting a monthly series of blog posts on <a href="https://www.insum.ca/power-ranking-oracle-apex-18-1-new-features-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power Ranking Oracle APEX 18.1 New Features</a>. My personal favourite is Social Login, but unfortunately it never made it to the top, even though it should!</p><p>When 4.2 was released, I was ecstatic. The introduction of the HTTP Header Variable authentication scheme allowed me to convince my boss back then, that APEX was the way to go. One critical success factor was the ease in integrating APEX application with the wider enterprise authentication framework that has already been established. However, you typically had to have a certain system architecture to capitalize on this authentication scheme.</p><p>With the newly released <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/HTMDB/establishing-user-identity-through-authentication.htm#GUID-CF10F6D7-768C-42F9-9362-4CF23BF1C4B8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Sign-in Authentication Scheme</a>, just about anyone can utilize the countless social platforms that provide OAuth2 logins.</p><p>As you might expected, it didn't take long for me to upgrade my personal APEX instance that runs on top of Oracle Database 11g Express Edition (XE) that is too many years out of date now. The authentication scheme makes calls to identity providers using the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/apex-18.1/AEAPI/APEX_WEB_SERVICE.htm#AEAPI537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>APEX_WEB_SERVICE</code></a> package and usually, that's over HTTPS. So yes, you will need to load up your Oracle wallets with the certificate chains. Read <a href="https://twitter.com/cczarski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carsten Czarski's</a> excellent explanation <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/apex-https-certificates-and-the-oracle-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You can get these from your browser as Carsten describes, or directly from the source such as DigiCert's <a href="https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list</a> of Root and Intermediate Certificates. However, the deal breaker here is that there is no convenient way to do this in XE. Even if you do successfully <a href="https://blog.hazrulnizam.com/openssl-workaround-oracle-xe-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a wallet for XE</a>, being so old and unpatched, it will still have difficulty negotiating with modern day certificates. </p><p>Thank goodness for reverse proxies! There are many ways to do this, but for me, I use <a href="/content/id/1706">Suez</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:</strong>

Like every other APEX fan out there, I was of course eager to get my hands dirty. Guess what was the first upcoming feature I took for a test drive?</p><p>You may have read my recent my <a href="https://www.insum.ca/saml2-single-sign-on-with-oracle-application-express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on using SAML2 for enabling single sign-on with cloud platforms like Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite. Well, this new authentication scheme available out of the box might just make the prescribed method obsolete. If you're interested to try it out yourself, here's an account of what I needed to do to enable Google sign-on. Hopefully it will provide you some guidance.</p><ul><li>The first thing you ought to do is to sign up for a Google account.</li><li>Next, login to Google's Developers <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">console</a>.</li><li>Create a project in order to enable the APIs you need to perform the OAuth2 login process.

However, take a closer look and you will see that the session identifier changes. Logging out only terminates your APEX session, but since your Google sign-on session is still valid, you are automatically authenticated back into the application. To ensure a proper logout, set the post-logout URL. For Google, this is <code>https://account.google.com/logout</code>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 15: Set the Post-Logout URL" src="/assets/images/post-logout-1c1d6611bf061ee6ef059894b618c3d1.jpg" width="1602" height="871" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Unfortunately, Google does not allow post-logout, third-party site redirects, so users will need to re-enter your site's URL again to access the application.</p><p>In the absence of official documentation, this is my best guess on how to set this up. As we progress towards the final release, we should get better clarity on the correctness of this article.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>HAPPY NEW YEAR</strong> and HAPPY AUTHENTICATING!</p><blockquote><u>UPDATE [May 4, 2018]</u>[apex.oracle.com](https://apex.oracle.com) was upgraded to APEX 18.1 (previously known as 5.2) last month. The instructions provided in this blog post is still relevant. Simply replace any links or references using `apexea` to `apex`.

            <description><![CDATA[Old Handwritten Book by Kiwihug}]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/kiwihug-393319_1280x720-0d17281e9d0058cd4774d5e9ef99a544.jpg">Old Handwritten Book by Kiwihug}</a></p><p>It's funny how JavaScript's 20th birthday was not as spectacular as it's shorter-named bretheren. When I first learned JavaScript in the late 1990's, I wasn't too excited as I was about Java, for two reasons most web developers know about JavaScript: weakly typed and non-standard browser implementation. The latter has been addressed by ECMA, but does that mean our code can now be more predictable and consistent?</p><p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> attempts to solve these issues by introducing static typing. This paves the way for a more structured language that results in better tooling and developer support. Think code hints. More importantly though, with compile-time error checking, we can be better assured of how the application would behave at runtime. And because we compile TypeScript to JavaScript, there is an opportunity to allow developers to work with modern ECMA specifications, but yet having the ability to compile down to earlier flavours of JS. All that without needing (not saying you shouldn't) to know the intricacies of transpilers and build management tools.</p><p>TypeScript introduces the concept of a declaration file. These files are like header files in C and package specifications in PL/SQL. Declaration files are usually written in files with a <code>.d.ts</code> file extension. They do not compile, instead, simply describe the functions and variables available in a JS library. They assist in TypeScript code compilation, and with IDE support, developer productivity is enhanced with features like IntelliSense and type-checking. In Code, type-checking is also available in JS with a simple comment at the top of the file: <code>//@ts-check</code>.</p><p>An <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX) developer is no stranger to tab-switching the APEX API documentation, browser (Page Designer) and I hope, a comparable desktop IDE. When writing the JavaScript bits of the APEX application, developers have a few choices. The best practice though, suggests that we consolidate code into JS files. This aids version control and testing. It's no easy feat though, ask any experience APEX developer. Fortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentmorneau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Morneau</a> came to the rescue with some <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-nitro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(APEX) Nitro</a> to boost productivity.</p><p>Vincent changed the paradigm of coding JS in APEX. We could gradually move some of our screen time away from Page Designer, and use mainstream code editors like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code (Code)</a>, <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atom</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sublime</a>, when working on JS, CSS and PL/SQL code. Without any fanfare, I had suggested and implemented TypeScript support in APEX Nitro that has been available since version 4.0.0-beta. For me, the final piece of the toolchain, would be a TS declaration file for the APEX JS API. Since there aren't any out there, I thought, why not write one? And so I did.</p><p>I am very excited about what benefits this might bring to the community and so, going away from my comfort zone, I have decided to make my work public so that fellow APEX developers can have a feel of what it's like working with TypeScript and what benefits it brings. I won't claim to be an expert in TypeScript or the APEX JS API. If you do find errors, please let me know through the usual channels!</p><p>Since TypeScript 2.0, declaration files are managed under the <a href="http://definitelytyped.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefinitelyTyped</a> project and made available through <a href="https://npmjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>. You can find a list of available declaration files under the organization <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~types" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@types</a>, or from their Github <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a>. For now, I have published my work at <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/orclapex-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/fuzziebrain/orclapex-js</a> with instructions on how to use it in your environment. Eventually though, I'd like to publish this under DefinitelyTyped repository, so keep in touch to be informed of changes.</p><p>Some day though, I hope that the APEX JS API would proudly wear the badge:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/standard-flat-d9d9225ff261ceb8cf10d1464dc96a7a.svg">TypeScript definitions on DefinitelyTyped (http://definitelytyped.org)</a></p><p>Happy coding!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Main Ballroom Before the Big Event Starts" src="/assets/images/nodejs-opening-2c16b8a4cff7b2dd4721c5c4eedbe93d.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The beautiful City of Vancouver (in British Columbia) played host to the North American <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js Interactive 2017</a> conference earlier this month. That close to my backyard, it was simply inexcusable not to attend! I wasted no time in getting the support of my employer and am glad I did. Here's a little summary of my experience and what I learned at the two-day conference to share.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keynotes">Keynotes<a class="hash-link" href="#keynotes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The conference began with a series of short (10 to 20 minutes) keynote sessions on a wide spectrum of topics. Mark Hinkle, Executive Director of the Node.js Foundation, kicked things off with a "State of the Union" address on how well the technology is progressing. Also announced was the launch of the Node.js certification exam beta. Look out for that if you are keen to demonstrate your Node.js skills. I signed up a while to be notified, but haven't heard anything since. Hopefully in the coming weeks.</p><p>Mark made a special mention of <a href="https://nodeschool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node School</a>, a self-organized effort to develop curriculum and resources for running Node.js training workshops. Very similar to the work that <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Carpentry</a> are doing to teach programming, Unix and data management to the research community. Given the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/oracle-announces-oracle-application-express-curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources</a> that Oracle has provided, it won't be difficult for the Oracle APEX community to emulate these initiatives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-class-citizen">First Class Citizen<a class="hash-link" href="#first-class-citizen" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Franzi Hinkelmann (Google) on Node.js&amp;#39; importance in V8" src="/assets/images/franzi-on-node-and-v8-a5e4b791103f54270c89dc615b6869f5.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q">
<a href="https://twitter.com/fhinkel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Franzi Hinkelmann</a> flew across an ocean and continent to let everyone know that supporting Node.js is now a priority for Google's V8 team. In fact, the recent <a href="https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-8-0-0-has-been-delayed-and-will-ship-on-or-around-may-30th-cd38ba96980d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delay</a> in releasing Node.js version 8 was in part, due to <a href="https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/05/launching-ignition-and-turbofan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major changes in V8</a> (Crankshaft <!-- -->→<!-- --> TurboFan + Ignition) in the V8 engine, and the team wanted the community to receive a version of Node.js that would be more future-proof. Great news!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-open-source">On Open Source<a class="hash-link" href="#on-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Panel on issues sustaining an open source ecosystem. From left: Jory Burson, Erin McKean, Tracy Hinds and Maggie Pint" src="/assets/images/panel-on-sustaining-open-source-ecosystem-50f4142459673510121203481af4349f.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q">
After round of lightning keynotes, the welcome session ended with an all-women panel to discuss some of the major challenges maintaining open source (OS) projects. I was especially thrilled to listen to what <a href="https://twitter.com/maggiepint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie Pint</a> had to share. Maggie's the maintainer of the <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moment.js</a>, a library for manipulating dates in JavaScript that I'm sure many web developers have used in their projects. She was very candid on some of the issues she has had to deal with maintaining the project, for example, how she has to deal with snide remarks on the Internet. A good reminder for us consumers to provide constructive criticisms without needing to be mean.</p><p>Maggie opened the panel discussion with her take on monetary rewards for working on OS projects. Funding to pay developers is nice, but having companies granting employees time towards working on OS projects is even better. Large companies like IBM and Microsoft can quite easily manage and provide such support, but it is a challenge for smaller companies with limited resources to do the same. For that reason, I am very grateful to <a href="https://www.insum.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insum Solutions</a> for the chance to participate and contribute to open source.</p><p>A third takeaway that stuck with me was that <strong>YOU</strong> don't have to be an expert coder to be able to contribute to open source. Most projects have other needs like writing technical writing, project management and community engagement. If you have these or other valuable skillsets, consider lending your expertise. The community will appreciate it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sessions">Sessions<a class="hash-link" href="#sessions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most, if not all sessions were about 20-30 minutes long. A little different from what ODTUGers are familiar with. This format provides attendees a lot of breath, but unfortunately, at the expense of depth.</p><p>As an APEX developer, who sometimes dable with Node.js, these were my picks:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1">Day 1<a class="hash-link" href="#day-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Everything You Wanted to Know About Logging by <a href="https://twitter.com/indexzero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Robbins</a></li><li>VS Code: Optimize Your Node.js Development "Inner Loop" by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Dias</a></li><li>Data Science Survival Kit (workshop) by Philipp Burckhardt and <a href="https://twitter.com/kgryte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Athan Reines</a></li><li>GraphQL in the Wild by <a href="https://twitter.com/southpolesteve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Faulkner</a></li><li>Build Interactive Workshops with Electron (workshop) by <a href="https://twitter.com/sethdvincent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Vincent</a></li><li>High Performance JS in V8 - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-marshall-01226130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Marshall</a></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="highlights">Highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#highlights" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Love <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code</a>!

My interest stems from a presentation I did at Kscope17 that examined the role of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microservices</a> in APEX applications. Since we run most of our code/logic on the database, the challenge is to find a fit for such technologies, especially in the cloud era. I expect to spend more time looking at this in the near future.</p><p>Bowden Kelly cited an interesting <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7985711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> that examined the significance of applying type-checking in JavaScript development. The study examined 400 projects on Github and found that 15% of bugs identified could have been fixed before a release. I am not surprised! The lack of type-checkign was one of the major reasons why I <strong>had</strong> a distaste for the language, and so, dialects like TypeScript and Coffeescript are a welcomed addition. For APEX developers, you might be interested to know that <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-nitro/issues/200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript support</a> was baked into APEX-Nitro v4.</p><p>The other interesting topics were on <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minikube</a> and Chrome's <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevTools</a>. Minikube allows you to run a local single-node <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a> cluster. This helps with simulation and testing of Docker container deployments. Though currently you would use <code>kubectl</code> to deploy, it sounds like in upcoming releases (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/docker-gives-into-invevitable-and-offers-native-kubernetes-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see report</a>), paid versions of Docker will support pushing containers to Kubernetes clusters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sticker Collection" src="/assets/images/sticker-collection-8e6e27e3b54fca35560360ccfb1d7719.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q">
Node.js Interactive is a great event to attend whether or not you are a hard-core Node.js programmer by trade. Would have been nice if lunch was provided so that attendees didn't need to compete with downtown office workers for food, but I suppose it had to do with the more affordable conference fee? And like all developer conferences, besides good content, the other benefit of attending is the opportunity to network with peers, speakers and vendors. I met some of the core people involved with Loopback project before Strongloop was acquired by IBM, and had the chance to allay my fears that Loopback was <strong>not</strong> going away in favour of some IBM-branded product. I was also pleasantly surprised to have met two friends at the event, and even learned a few things about GraphQL and Serverless from them!</p><p>The conference returns to Vancouver in October 2018, so for the folks heading to Oracle OpenWorld next year, consider planning a trip north to our beautiful city. There's much knowledge and scenery to soak up!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo by &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://unsplash.com/@moudy100&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hisham Abo-hamad&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on Unsplash" src="/assets/images/ismalia-egypt-a758ede2cf28c9e744b4dd6e266c48f6.jpg" width="4093" height="2303" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Earlier this year (2017), I had the privilege to share with the community, some of the work and experiences I gained helping to build some of the blocks that form the foundation of <a href="https://apex.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.world</a>. In my presentations, I had shared some of the challenges I had integrating RESTful web services with <a href="https://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express</a> (APEX). A crippling issue involved the use of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Express Edition</a> (Oracle XE) and communicating with web services over a secured protocol. The by-product of that experience led to the development of a simple <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> application, which I named <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/suez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suez</a>.</p><p>Traffic flowing through the Internet can be sniffed and used for nefarious purposes. Therefore we are encouraged, whenever possible, to use a secured network transport protocol to safeguard against these attacks. It is almost mandatory when the communication between client and server contains secrets or personally identifiable information (PII), e.g passwords, secure tokens and users' credit card details.</p><p>For content served over web protocols, we use Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). These involve the use of digitally-signed certificates belonging to a trust chain that allows systems to verify identity and provides keys to communicate securely using encryption. Most Certification Authorities (CA) offer these for an annual fee, but more recently, a consortium led by Mozilla and a few other partners, created a new CA that made SSL certificates available to everyone. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Encrypt</a> is an open CA that provides services and tools to automatically verify and sign certificate requests for <strong>free</strong>!</p><p>Many API providers offer web services over HTTPS and consumers are highly encouraged, and sometimes forced to use this protocol for accessing content. The Oracle Wallet is used to store and manage SSL certificates that are required for establishing connections (SSL handshakes). For Oracle Database Standard and Enterprise Editions, a tool known as the Oracle Wallet Manager (OWM) is used to conveniently add and remove certificates. Not surprisingly, this is absent in the free Express Edition. A workaround using OpenSSL was prescribed by Hazrul Nizam's <a href="https://blog.hazrulnizam.com/openssl-workaround-oracle-xe-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Good read!</p><p>However, like any other web technology, SSL is prone to weaknesses and vulnerabilities and hence, it continues to evolve. For example, older SSL certificates that were signed with a weaker hashing algorithm SHA-1, have been made obsolete as it was been proven to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prone to collisions</a>. For older versions of the Oracle DB, an active Oracle Support contract allows you access to patches that upgrade the wallet to handle newer hashes. However, if you are developing using Oracle XE, then you are out of luck. Well... kinda.</p><p>Without any upgrades to support newer hash algorithms, we were forced to improvise a solution for integrating Slack and apex.world. This is done through a proxy that accepts communications on a non-secure HTTP channel, relay the request and then pipe the response back to the caller. However, rather than write code for every API that needed to be accessed, I wrote Suez.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Suez usage example" src="/assets/images/suez-dca74c3a2097027dd538e4554ddf1fcf.png" width="1280" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Suez relies on <a href="https://twitter.com/chimurai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Chim's</a> <a href="https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a> for creating simple web proxies using Node.js, and that in turn is powered by Nodejitsu's <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">node-http-proxy</a>. It uses the request's hostname value, looks up the configuration and then routes the call to the intended API target. Instructions on how to configure and deploy the application is detailed in the project's <a href="https://github.com/fuzziebrain/suez/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a>.</p><p>I am hoping that this small utility would help developers get started on integrating cool APIs and build even cooler APEX applications. That said, I would end by emphasizing that orthdox approaches to security are always preferred. If budget allows, continue to rely on SSL certificates not only for securing end-to-end communications, but also, verifying that your application is talking to authorized servers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Then read on!</p><p>Making sure your application is up and running 24/7 doesn't need to be a daunting task, plus it may not even cost you a dime! <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UptimeRobot</a> provides <strong>50 free monitors</strong> that can poll your servers using the smallest interval of 5 minutes. You can easily monitor websites and receive multi-channel notifications of downtime. No excuse!</p><p>There are several solutions out there for server monitoring including the ever popular, open-sourced <a href="https://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nagios</a>. However, build-your-own solutions often require more resources to set up. It only makes sense to host the monitoring software on an independent server - possibly even network/infrastructure - that your APEX instance uses. Not forgetting the much needed knowledge and time spent to set up the systems.</p><p>UptimeRobot provides monitoring services for free or for fee. You can choose four monitoring types:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1ping">1.Ping<a class="hash-link" href="#1ping" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Monitors servers by sending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICMP</a> packets and waiting for a response. Sending ping requests are not logged, so that can be a good thing. However, for web servers, a ping response is not a reliable measure of whether the required service is operational. A server can respond to pings even though the server application, e.g. Apache HTTPD server, is not running.</p><p>To configure a Ping Monitor:</p><ol><li>Select the monitor type <em>Ping</em>.</li><li>Enter a friendly name.</li><li>Enter the <em>IP address</em> or <em>fully-qualified domain name</em> to monitor, e.g. <em>111.111.111.111</em>, <em>websvr.contoso.com</em>.</li><li>Set the monitoring interval.</li><li>Select the contact(s) to be notified.</li><li>Click <em>Create Monitor</em>.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-port">2.

All three are important services responsible for delivering APEX applications.

It really depends on what your definition of "uptime" is. To me, that includes having the APEX instance deliver the expected outcomes. Any errors as a result of application runtime execution, should also classify as downtime. Often, APEX would still return a HTTP status code <code>200</code> even if an error had occured. Either we trap these events during error handling and then return the appropriate status code, or create a strategy involving keywords and then monitor these terms to signal service status for better insights to availability.</p><p>That said, regardless of what you choose, anything is better than nothing. So get monitored now!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Briefly, the solution involves using <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagrant</a> to create a very affordable virtual machine (VM) on <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=41672b20d515344de465e9ed44c1a75356445597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linode's</a> pool of servers and run the <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/OXAR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OXAR</a> build script, to setup the APEX instance very quickly and painlessly.</p><p>However, all that power (and savings) comes with great responsibilty. </p><p>Without the aid of managed services, the passionate APEX developer will have to handle the day-to-day administration of the system and database. One of the common tasks required of a developer is to ensure emails can be sent from APEX appplications successfully. This not only involves understanding how to use the APIs to generate and send emails, but also knowledge on maximizing the chance that emails are delivered successfully to the intended audience and do not end up in the spam bin.</p><p>So what's involved in getting email setup on your OXAR instance?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-one">Part One<a class="hash-link" href="#part-one" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Ensure that a suitable mail daemon is running on your server. If you used the method that I prescribed in my earlier post, then you would be running a <a href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CentOS</a> 7 server with <a href="http://www.postfix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postfix</a> installed, but not running on boot. Let's be sure by executing the following command:
<code>&gt; sudo rpm -q postfix</code></p><p>If Postfix is installed, you should see an output with the full package name, e.g. <code>postfix-2.10.1-6.el7.x86_64</code>.</p><p>If absent, install it using yum by executing the command:
<code>&gt; sudo yum install -y postfix</code></p><p>Next, check that the service is running by executing the command:
<code>&gt; sudo systemctl is-active postfix</code></p><p>The screen output should provide some clues about whether the service has been started and/or enabled to start on boot:</p><ul><li><code>active</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> service is running</li><li><code>inactive</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> service is not running but enabled</li><li><code>unknown</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> service is not running and not enabled</li></ul><p>If the service is in <code>active</code> state, then check that it is also enabled to start on boot by executing the command:
<code>&gt; sudo systemctl is-enabled postfix</code></p><p>The system should respond with either <code>enabled</code> or <code>disabled</code>.</p><p>To enable the service to start on boot, execute:
<code>&gt; sudo systemctl enable postfix</code></p><p>To start the service:
<code>&gt; sudo systemctl start postfix</code></p><p>Next, configure Postfix if necessary. In most situations, you can use Postfix to send emails directly. If that is the case, the default configuration should generally work just fine. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="email-relay">Email Relay<a class="hash-link" href="#email-relay" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Some developers have access to SMTP servers and might like to use them to circumvent spam-related issues. It would be prudent to assume that these servers, if exposed to remote requests, will require authentication. And because it is the Internet, using a secured network protocol to authenticate is highly recommended. If you have no problems setting up SSL/TLS support for SMTP connections, then you might not want to use Postfix at all. You can configure the SMTP host, port and credentials in the APEX Instance Administration. this is addressed in Part Two.</p><p>However, if you are unable to set up a secure connection, then consider using Postfix by configuring it as a secure relay. I will use Gmail as an example. Here's what you need to do:</p><ol><li>Install Cyrus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SASL</a> plain authentication package:
<code>&gt; sudo yum install -y cyrus-sasl-plain</code></li><li>Execute the command:
<code>&gt; sudo echo "smtp.gmail.com myaccount@gmail.com:mysecurepassword" &gt; /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd"</code></li><li>Execute the next command to hash the file to protect it from prying eyes:
<code>&gt; sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd</code></li><li>Don't leave the plain text file lying around:
<code>&gt; sudo rm -f /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd</code></li><li>Configure Postfix stored in the configuration file <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>.

The HELO greeting simply checks that your domain has a valid forward and reverse entry. The latter might be a little harder to achieve since PTR records, reverse DNS mappings, are usually managed by the organization that issued the IP address. Most spam filters recognize this and would accept the email as long as there is one. </p><p>The single most important factor seems to be how the SPF records are set for your domain. It's not difficult for anyone to setup a SMTP server and with an appropriate email api/client, spoof a domain that he/she does not own and send out unauthorized emails. For example, if your APEX application attempts to use an <em>@yahoo.com</em> or <em>@gmail.com</em> email address sent from an unauthorized SMTP server, then these emails will likely be flagged as spam. Servers with strict policies might even outrightly reject these emails.</p><p>SPF is a <strong>single</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TXT</a> record in the DNS that uses <a href="http://www.openspf.org/Mechanisms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mechanisms</a> to help verify if the incoming email originated from an authorized source. Commonly used mechanisms include: <code>a</code>, <code>mx</code>, <code>include</code>, <code>ip4</code> and <code>all</code>. Each mechanism in the record can have one of four qualifiers (<code>-</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> fail, <code>~</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> softfail, <code>+</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> pass or <code>?</code> <!-- -->⇒<!-- --> neutral) that email filters could then use to decide on whether to flag as spam. </p><p>Below is the SPF record for the domain <code>bcoug.org</code>. It begins with the SPF version number and then six mechanisms. Five of them state different ways to resolve an authorized source. The last is a catch-all to state that the email source is unauthorized.</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token assign-left variable" style="color:#36acaa">v</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain">spf1 a mx include:_spf.google.com include:servers.mcsv.net ip4:204.244.186.184/32 ~all</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Before adding a SPF record to your DNS, test it first using the <a href="http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tool</a> provided by Kitterman.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo by Ben Duchac on Unsplash" src="/assets/images/ben-duchac-66002-b9aca41cf37255e100507164a3d71b7a.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After reading the article "<a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/06/r-community.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The R community is one of R's best features</a>" by <a href="https://twitter.com/revodavid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Smith</a>, I felt there were a lot of similarities between the R and Oracle APEX communities, and hence, was inspired to pen a copycat post. So here it is:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/orclapex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#orclapex</a> hashtag - </li><li>Oracle APEX Ladies - none yet, but <a href="http://www.odtug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODTUG</a> has a strong community of women and some of them are top APEX developers. I'm sure we'll see a similar group forming in the near future! (/me nudge <a href="https://twitter.com/McilroyJackie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@McilroyJackie</a>)</li><li><a href="https://apex.world/ords/f?p=APEX_WORLD:MEETUPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Oracle APEX Meetup Groups</a> - we have meetup groups all over the world, many of them supported by ODTUG's <a href="http://www.odtug.com/page/meetup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GetInvolved</a> program. The link brings you to a only list of meetups organized through <a href="https://meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetup.com</a>. I hear there are more groups, especially in Asia (good number in Japan) that use a different platform for organizing their meetings.</li><li>Oracle APEX Newsletters - some evangelists maintain their own aggregate of the week's best news on APEX, e.g. <a href="http://paper.li/RoelH/1333719828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APEX Weekly</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/RoelH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roel Hartman</a>. Others like <a href="https://apex.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.world</a> publishes a monthly newsletter, and ODTUG has their <a href="https://twitter.com/orclapexblogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog aggregator</a> that tweets out new posts as they bake fresh, so take your pick!</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/orclapexblogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX Blogs</a> - oops, I jumped the gun on this one.</li><li>The official <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express Curriculum</a> from the source - it's free and open sourced too. Enough said!</li><li>Oracle APEX Conferences - take your pick (in order of when they usually happen)<ul><li>APEX World</li><li>APEX Connection</li><li>Kscope (My Choice Award ;-) )</li><li>And a few smaller events. Use this <a href="https://apex.world/ords/f?p=100:230:::NO:::" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to track when and where they happen every year. Also, not to forget that there are some (a few) APEX sessions at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/openworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle OpenWorld</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Github - R code is typically shared in the form of installable packages, and very similar to <a href="https://npmjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm packages</a> for <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>. For Oracle APEX and PLSQL developers, we usually share code either in the form of plugins, PLSQL packages or tools. Here are some examples:<ul><li>[Plugins]<!-- --> On <a href="https://apex.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apex.world</a>, click on "Plug-ins" &gt; "Plug-ins".</li><li>[Plugins]<!-- --> <a href="http://www.apex-plugin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.apex-plugin.com/</a> (some contribution might have the source code in Github repositories)</li><li>[PLSQL]<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oos-utils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oos-utils</a></li><li>[PLSQL]<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger</a></li><li>[PLSQL]<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/mortenbra/alexandria-plsql-utils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/mortenbra/alexandria-plsql-utils</a></li><li>[PLSQL]<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL</a></li></ul></li><li>Consortium? Hmm... I guess the closest would ODTUG's <a href="http://odtug.com/apex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application Express Community</a>. The community has otherwise been very spontaneous. Everyone is and can be involved, and that includes members of the Oracle APEX development team.</li></ul><p>But there's more:</p><ul><li><a href="https://orclapex.slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> - grab your invite by signing up as an apex.world member, and chat realtime with other members of the community. </li><li><a href="https://community.oracle.com/community/database/developer-tools/application_express" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OTN Community Forums</a> - probably the oldest social platform to have your questions answered. </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/oapexquestions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter bot</a> that monitors and tweets <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow's</a> Oracle APEX questions so that they get maximum reach.</li></ul><p>I happen to think that there's much synergy between these two powerful platforms. Why? Let me attempt to convince you why Oracle APEX makes a great <del>Research</del> Data Management platform in a few bullet points:</p><ul><li>It allows <del>research</del> groups to quickly create, collect and securely manage data.</li><li>Standards-based development without the fuss.</li><li>Install the <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/quicksql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick SQL</a> package app, and use markdown-like text to generate data models, and even sample data!</li><li>Start from low code and advance to lots-of-code if required.</li><li>Integrates readily with other systems and technologies through the use of web services, e.g. R, which I discussed in this earlier <a href="https://www.insum.ca/oracle-apex-statistics-r-u-serious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</li><li>Analyze the data exclusively in R using a package like <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROracle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ROracle</a></li><li>Start for free (forever) or scale up later by paying for more advanced features.</li></ul><p>That's a lot of bullet points. Just one more. Much like R:</p><blockquote><p>"<!-- -->[The]<!-- --> community is one of greatest assets of <!-- -->[Oracle APEX]<!-- -->, and is an essential component of what makes <!-- -->[Oracle APEX]<!-- --> useful, easy, and fun to use. And you couldn't find a nicer and more welcoming group of people to be a part of."</p></blockquote><p>Last but not least, if you are an R enthusiast who is curious to find out more about Oracle APEX, please feel free to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzziebrain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">me</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This year's event was held in the beautiful JW Marriott Hill Country Resport and Spa, San Antonio, Texas. This is my fourth Kscope, third as a speaker, second at San Antonio, and first time taking home an award!</p><p>Kscope has always been about content and this year was no exception. Though unfortunately, I did not get to attend as many sessions as I would have liked to. This year, I spent more time at our company's exhibitor booth, as well as hiding in my hotel room, preparing myself for the two sessions I had to deliver. Stakes were high, as many speakers before me have set the standards very high. </p><p>Even though I could not learn as much as previous years, I appreciated very much the increased amount of contact time I had with partners and fellow attendees, sharing some of the stuff I had worked on in the year passed. Learning doesn't only come through listening. You gain much by sharing too!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="food-and-swag">Food and Swag<a class="hash-link" href="#food-and-swag" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Healthy, tasty breakfast!" src="/assets/images/quinoa-3dd9885489976673b8fc85c22cdf8e22.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Someone claimed that food at Kscope was one of the best, and I agree. Having attended several other conferences before, I am confident to say that ODTUG serves up some of the most delicious cuisine. I was never really hungry as there was always ample to eat and enjoy!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="San Antonio Sunset" src="/assets/images/swag-eed4603dd8cc4e7a6aae2a12caebcc15.jpg" width="720" height="1280" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Swag-wise, ODTUG always seems to hit it right with a high quality bag containing lots of goodies. That includes the indispensible power bank that kept my phone alive. Allowing me to keep in constant communication with the team and of course, tweeting during the day uninterrupted. </p><p>This year however, it was Insum's swag that stood out. I know, I'm biased! The company's cowboy hat, fidget spinners and stickers! It wasn't just our friends and partners that enjoyed these wonderful collectibles, but I got to enjoy them too!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-sessions-and-sharing">On Sessions and Sharing<a class="hash-link" href="#on-sessions-and-sharing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Preparing and delivering a successful presentation is tough, and I have a long road ahead to become as season and polished speaker like some of my peers at  Insum. However, as the wise <a href="https://twitter.com/joelkallman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Kallman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JuergenSchuster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juergen Schuster</a> would advise me, I need to persevere, find opportunities and keep honing those presentation skills!</p><p>I have presented a few times now at different conferences, but this year, something felt different! It was the happiness that I felt when attendees came up to me  after the session to let me know they had faced similar challenges, and that your sharing's gonna help in some little way!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-all-about-people">It's All About People<a class="hash-link" href="#its-all-about-people" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Besides great food and content, the other huge advantage for being at Kscope in person is the people! It's a fantastic opportunity to meet people you hear about on Twitter, webinars and books! Back at SAT, I reminisced the first time I met <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickCimolini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Cimolini</a> at the hotel restaurant. I was estatic and went over to introduce myself. I must have surprised him! And who would have thought that four years later, he'd be the dedicated sheperd, who made sure I got to work okay, during my two-week induction at the Montreal office.</p><p>This year, I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/mtremblaydev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxime</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Dani3lSun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Hochleitner</a> for the first time. And then the great conversations with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmelx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/milobandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Potter</a>. Michael makes this trip across the Pacific annually, so no excuse for those of you living on the North American Plate not to join us! It's also wonderful to catch up with fellow Vancouverites Mirek, Nada and Liron, who made his debut appearance at Kscope. I'm sure we're gonna see him around the ODTUG community a lot more going forward!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Working with the best crew" src="/assets/images/vr-ea3b3efa4a91bcdd9a45c448e9612130.jpg" width="3264" height="2448" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Last but not least, I work remote and alone across the continent and so, it always brings joy meeting up with the Insum crew. This year, we had Michel, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fr4ncis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Francis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/monty_latiolais" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monty</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dschleis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rimblas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge</a> my roommate. And I'm especially delighted that we had our Kscope newbies Daniel and <a href="https://twitter.com/McilroyJackie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackie</a> join in the fun!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Winner of the ODTUG Innovation Award 2017" src="/assets/images/nitro-8c00761acbd18de3aa9e8e5bd412c0e2.jpg" width="3120" height="4160" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then the guy who made us all really proud. Scoring the ODTUG Innovation Award 2017 win and the much covetted Oracle ACE title, <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentmorneau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Morneau</a>! Vincent won the award for his outstanding work on <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-nitro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APEX Nitro</a>. Again, if you are an Oracle APEX developer working mostly on the frontend, then this is a <em>FREE</em> product you don't wanna miss! It's gonna ease the pain of coding JavaScript and CSS considerably, improve your productivity and be a hero! Just like Vincent!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Not about the breakfast, but the bacon." src="/assets/images/breakfast-3effdaea3fd9d5744ea480c13007a7dc.jpg" width="4160" height="3120" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And not to forget our troops back in homebase who cover our absence and are readily on standby to facilitate our sales and marketing efforts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel like I have gone a full circle from my early days writing my blogs (or weblogs) in flat files as opposed to storing content in a database through a content management system (CMS). Prior to using <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordpress</a>, I was heavily invested in developing with <a href="https://www.drupal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal</a>, and consider myself privileged to have used the knowledge of both platforms for work. All of sudden now, I have an urge to go back to my roots and focusing on creating blog posts without the bells and whistles.</p><p>So instead of manipulating raw HTML tags, I found a neat little tool written in <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> that allows me to write posts and pages in Markdown, while making use templates and plugins to generate the ubiquitous Web 2.0 technologies with minimal effort. It is called <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexo</a>. I am not going through the basics of how to install and configure a blog site using Hexo as I find the documentation concise but comprehensive enough to get anyone started.</p><p>However, what I think might be helpful is what I did to further customize the size to my taste.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-migrating-posts-from-the-old-wordpress-website">1. Migrating Posts from the Old WordPress Website<a class="hash-link" href="#1-migrating-posts-from-the-old-wordpress-website" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>I have a few posts on my previous blog and wanted to move over as many posts and pages as I could. The simple procedure from the <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/migration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section</a> on migrating from other blog platforms is easy to follow. For WordPress though, You do have a choice on what you want to export and you can opt to export only posts if that is all that you needed to move over. Once you have a copy of the export XML file, copy that over to your site folder (<code>&lt;site-folder&gt;</code>) and run the command <code>$ hexo migrate wordpress my_wordpress_site.xml</code>. That will convert your posts (in XML format) to individual Markdown files. Posts and drafts are placed in separate folders and you can find them in <code>&lt;site-folder&gt;/source/_posts</code>  and <code>&lt;site-folder&gt;/source_drafts</code> respectively. If you need to move them around, here's your chance!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-theming">2. Theming<a class="hash-link" href="#2-theming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This is probably one of the most important tasks!</p><p>Out of the box, Hexo provides you with the Landscape theme. You might also have realized that the box titles on the sidebar are written in Chinese. If you are reading this post in English, I'm gonna guess that this isn't what you want. The quick fix is to copy the file <code>&lt;site-folder&gt;/themes/landscape/languages/defaut.yml</code> and name it <code>en.yml</code>.</p><p>For me though, it's a no-brainer to seek out an alternative theme. I started out with the <a href="https://github.com/chrisjlee/hexo-theme-zurb-foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theme</a> based on Zurb's <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundation</a>, but found myself wandering back to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> as that is a framework that I am currently more familiar with. So I decided to grab a copy of the Bootstrap-based <a href="https://github.com/cgmartin/hexo-theme-bootstrap-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theme</a> instead. Be sure to follow the instructions on what else to install and configure to get the theme running correctly for your website.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-plugins">3. Plugins<a class="hash-link" href="#3-plugins" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>That's easy to share. Here's a list that wasn't too hard for me to compile:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">{</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  ...</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  "dependencies": {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo": "^3.1.1",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-front-matter-excerpt": "^0.2.0",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-generator-archive": "^0.1.4",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-generator-category": "^0.1.3",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-generator-index": "^0.2.0",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-generator-sitemap": "^1.1.2",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-generator-tag": "^0.2.0",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-migrator-wordpress": "^0.1.2",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-renderer-ejs": "^0.1.1",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-renderer-marked": "^0.2.9",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-renderer-stylus": "^0.3.0",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-server": "^0.1.3",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-tag-bootstrap": "0.0.8",</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "hexo-tag-fontawesome": "^1.0.0"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  }</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Bear in mind though, that this is a dynamic compilation and will more than likely change in the near future! There are several <a href="https://hexo.io/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugins</a> available to you depending on your development style. So pick and choose what you feel is necessary and install/uninstall with simple <code>npm</code> commands. Just remember to include the <code>--save</code> parameter to persist your changes.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-version-control">4. Version Control<a class="hash-link" href="#4-version-control" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>It is almost always necessary to store versions of your work for the purpose of backup and guarding against accidental disasters. The preferred choice for me is to use <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a>. For the purpose of working with my personal website, I opted to use <a href="https://www.bitbucket,org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitBucket</a> as they give me a much needed option of keeping my repositories private.</p><p>I created two for my website. One for storing content, and the other for my theme of choice. I added the theme as a submodule in the main site repository. This allows me to work on both content and theme concurrently. Any change to the theme (as a submodule) can then be pushed and committed to the repository, almost at the same time. Take note that you might have to first commit the submodule before updating the repository with changes in the main project.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-tooling">5. Tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#5-tooling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>There is certainly no dearth of Markdown editors out there. Just take a look at this <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="78 Tools for Writing and Previewing Markdown by Mashable">list</a> of 78 compiled by Mashable in 2013! Since I do most of my development in <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atom</a> these days, I had to find a package I could use to make it easier to edit my posts. I have barely started using <a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown-writer</a> and it is already making my life a lot easier with shortcuts and widgets. The other neat feature is its support for <a href="https://hexo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexo</a>! It actually understands the concept of draft and post in Hexo context so in theory, you would never have to use the commandline... well... not much at least.</p><p>The one thing I desire most in any kind of web editing tool is the ability to take a screenshot and paste it into the active document. If you come across such a plugin or tool, please don't hesitate to put a comment below or tweet me!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>I love Hexo. I love Markdown. I love Atom. Most of all, I love simplicity! Hope you've enjoyed reading this post as much as I have writing it. This is after all, my virgin post using Hexo!</p><p>HAPPY BLOGGING!</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a follow-up to our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YVR/events/223156789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second ORCLAPEX-YVR meetup</a> on <strong>June 17, 2015</strong>, and to supplement <a href="https://twitter.com/trentschafer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trent Schafer</a>'s excellent <a href="http://apextips.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/building-oracle-11g-xe-server-with-apex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on how you could build an Oracle APEX instance, here's a simple procedure that you can use to stand up your personal APEX development environment in probably much less than 30 minutes depending on your Internet connection bandwidth!</p><p>This method involves the use of <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagrant</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle VirtualBox</a>, and will work on any host operating system (OS) that both software supports. So let's get started!</p><ol><li>Download and save the following installation packages&nbsp;on your computer:</li></ol><ul><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Database Express Edition 11g Release 2</a></li><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/downloads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Application Express 5.0</a></li><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/rest-data-services/downloads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle REST Data Services 3.0</a></li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Download and install&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a>&nbsp;(you may use other Git clients if preferred, e.g. <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SourceTree</a>)</li><li>Download and install&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle</a><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox</a> (version 5.0.x)</li><li>Download and install&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagrant</a> (version 1.7.x)</li><li>Start a terminal session or the Command Prompt for the next few&nbsp;steps. <strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;"vagrant" should have been added to your system path during the installation.</li><li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oraclexe-apex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oraclexe</a><a href="https://github.com/OraOpenSource/oraclexe-apex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">-apex</a> project:
<code>$ git clone https://github.com/OraOpenSource/OXAR.git</code></li><li>Change your working directory to oraclexe-apex
<code>$ cd OXAR</code></li><li>Copy the installation files into files subdirectory. <img loading="lazy" alt="OXAR project folder structure" src="/assets/images/oraclexe-apex-project-dir-structure-112x300-1a615fae6a6b44a23cecd19277bbcab4.png" width="112" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></li><li>Update the config.properties. Specify the location and filenames of the installation files. <!-- -->![OXAR Project Configuration Changes]<!-- -->./assets/oraclexe-apex-project-config-changes-300x74.png)</li><li>Execute the command:
<code>$ vagrant up</code></li><li>Done! Wait for the build process to complete and then test your instance using your browser and point to <a href="http://localhost:50080/ords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://localhost:50080/ords/</a>. If you see the APEX login&nbsp;page, then you are good to go!
By default, the Vagrant is configured to use the <a href="http://centos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centos</a> 7 base box provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Puppet Labs</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first adventure in organizing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meetups</a> started late last year with the creation of the Vancouver Research Data Management Roundtable. The goal of the group was to gather members of both academia and industry, and engage in discussion on topics, issues and solutions in managing research data. We have since found a new home for the group. If&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/services/research-data/rdm/what-is-rdm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RDM</a>&nbsp;excites you, then I warmly welcome you to sign up for our <a href="https://lists.ubc.ca/scripts/wa.exe?A0=VANRDM-ROUNDTABLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mailing list</a>&nbsp;kindly hosted by <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The University of British Columbia</a>. Though it does help that you live around the area! We have a monthly "Data Cafe" that is co-organized with the UBC library folks.</p><p>With that move, the opportunity opened up for me to start yet another meetup to make sure the <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> community in Canada&nbsp;had adequate representation on both the east and west coasts! Notice has been served to current VanRDM members, asking them to cross over to the new mailing list before I overhaul the website. The link however, has been secured.</p><p>I will not be pruning the members list come <strong>February 28</strong>, choosing instead to let members decide whether to stay or leave. After all, APEX is one of the best tools out there to help facilitate best practices in data management. So if you are like me: (a) living in Vancouver and (b) passionate about Oracle APEX, then I strongly encourage&nbsp;you to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/orclapex-YVR/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up</a> immediately!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I traditionally write a summary of what I learned and experienced at each technical conference I attend. I do this in order to help both my sponsors&nbsp;and I to&nbsp;take stock of how much value was created by attending a training&nbsp;event. I find this a good practice and give credit to my previous employer <a href="http://www.nyp.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanyang Polytechnic</a> for instilling this culture in me. This year, I decided to do this as a blog post as well and hopefully, provide others an opportunity to decide if <a href="http://www.kscope15.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KScope15</a> should be on your training calendar next year.</p><h1>Sessions</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Space Needle&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/kscope14_spaceneedle-09ebf6c56d7192ee0d2de8ee98f20a25.jpg" width="242" height="600" class="img_ev3q">
KScope typically begins with a community-based symposium during which representatives from <a href="http://oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a> provide a day-long marathon of sessions that usually gives quite a good insight into what's on the horizon. This year, for <a href="http://apex.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle APEX</a> developers, our eyes are on what to expect with the upcoming - game changing - features of APEX 5.0<!-- -->.<!-- --> Not surprisingly, Joel Kallman (<a href="https://twitter.com/joelkallman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@joelkallman</a>) and his talented team of developers did not disappoint and provided us hours of woos and wows. The chant "<a href="http://youtu.be/StTqXEQ2l-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything is Awesome</a>" was soon on everyone's slides, minds and lips.</p><p>Well, I didn't attend all the APEX symposium sessions. Steven Feuerstein (<a href="https://twitter.com/sfonplsql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sfonplsql</a>) spoke about the "Best PL/SQL Features You Never Heard Of" and I was glad I attended.</p><p>There were quite a few other APEX sessions that caught my attention this year. John Scott (<a href="https://twitter.com/aejes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@aejes</a>) and Dan McGhan (<a href="https://twitter.com/dmcghan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dmcghan</a>) presented very interesting use cases for Javascript frameworks <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="AngularJS">AngularJS</a>. Peter Raganitsch (<a href="https://twitter.com/PeterRaganitsch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PeterRaganitsch</a>) and Christian Rokitta (<a href="https://twitter.com/crokitta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@crokitta</a>) focused on important issues and lessons to learn from Oracle Packaged Applications when making APEX applications public. Kris Rice (<a href="https://twitter.com/krisrice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@krisrice</a>) talked about the best practices and considerations when deploying Oracle RESTful Data Services (ORDS, a.k.a. APEX listener) for production, as well as some interesting tricks and extensibility features. And I attended a hands-on session that provided examples on how you can setup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Continuous integration">Continuous Integration</a> for your APEX development environment. Lessons/tips that I could definitely apply back at work.</p><p>At heart, I am still very much a Java developer. So this year, I decided forgo a couple of novice-level APEX sessions to learn some basics about ADF. I attend two sessions. Luc Bors (<a href="https://twitter.com/lucb_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lucb_</a>) presented on ADF Essentials and Frédéric Desbiens (<a href="https://twitter.com/BlueberryCoder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BlueberryCoder</a>) provided a lively one-hour ADF quick start session. These were fruitful and I found ADF to be Java's equivalent to APEX in developing web applications more productive.</p><p>I attended a few sessions on data modelling using Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler that turned out to be a good decision. Learned a few tips and tricks from Kent Graziano (<a href="https://twitter.com/KentGraziano" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KentGraziano</a>) on how to use SDDM a little better. There's really a lot of features in SDDM that can help improve the process and working with clients better.</p><p>There were many others I would have liked to attend, including freshly minted Oracle ACE Jorge Rimblas' (<a href="https://twitter.com/rimblas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@rimblas</a>) session on "Creating a Business-Oriented UI in APEX", but he was competing against Tom Kyte's (<a href="https://twitter.com/OracleAskTom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OracleAskTom</a>) "Five Best Things to Happen to SQL". Woes of a conference attendee!</p><p>If I had to pick sessions that made the biggest impact, they would be:</p><ol><li>"Application Express: Fast = True" by Joel Kallman. What did I learn? Knowing APEX isn't quite enough to build good scalable applications. We need to have and invest in Oracle Database skills.</li><li>"The Database and Developer's Toolkit: How to Find and Fix Your (APEX, Java, .NET, OBIEE, etc.) Application Performance Problem" by Cary Millsap (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaryMillsap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CaryMillsap</a>). That's a very long title for a talk, and so was the session - two hours! Amazingly though, Cary was able to take us through the entire session with ease. He captured my attention throughout. I liked how his slides were concise, well laid out and used pleasant pastel colours. I definitely have lots to learn, besides measuring application metrics and troubleshooting performance issues, how to present well!</li></ol><h1>Competition Finale</h1><p>Late last year, I was approached by Roel Hartman (<a href="https://twitter.com/RoelH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RoelH</a>) and Martin D'Souza (<a href="https://twitter.com/martindsouza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@martindsouza</a>) to help organize the <a href="http://competition.odtug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APEX Theming Competition 2014</a> as a prelude to KScope. It wasn't too hard to persuade me to take up this challenge and I'm glad I did. Learned a little bit more about APEX theming myself. The competition ended with&nbsp;the results announced at the annual APEX Open Mic Night.&nbsp;I was definitely nervous (as Joel picked out)… who wouldn't be. I was speaking to well-attended community event with some of the best APEX brains&nbsp;in the world! So please excuse my jitters if you were there that night.</p><p>My heartiest congratulations to Robert Schaefer (<a href="https://twitter.com/SchaeferRob" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SchaeferRob</a>) who won the competition with this <a href="http://apex-plugin.com/oracle-apex-plugins/odtug-theming-competition/contribution-by-r.schaefer_385.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry</a>. It's a pity though that I wasn't able to meet him in person and present him with the grand prize.</p><h1>Should You Attend KScope15?</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;ODTUG Rocks at the Experience Music Project&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/kscope14_emp-b620e118cab7f9a2a7f2bf2ac8ec3915.jpg" width="600" height="450" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In a nutshell... <strong>YES!!!</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.odtug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODTUG</a> always puts up a great show. Check out my previous blog <a href="/content/id/274">post</a>&nbsp;on my KScope12 experience. They didn't disappoint again this year with a great selection of topics, swag, venue, hotel and FOOD! You can also almost always expect a unique experience at their special events night. I rarely attend such events when I'm at conferences, but this year, I made an exception and was glad&nbsp;I did.</p><p>Because ODTUG is home to several technology-specific communities, it is easy to pick up a breadth of new skills and knowledge at one conference. For me, I certainly benefited from attending topics from the DBA, Development, ADF and APEX tracks. This is useful for me as I undertake several complimentary roles in my current job.</p><p>Last but not least, ODTUG is the COMMUNITY, where members know each other by name. Every time this community meets, it's like a family reunion. While there might be sibling (but constructive) rivalry at times, there remains a strong bond between members that allows everyone to share each other's successes and pains. My job situation is far from ideal at the moment, but I certainly hope to stay working with Oracle technologies and continue growing with this community in the years to come. And maybe, I'll get to meet you in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=26.0213888889,-80.175&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=26.0213888889,-80.175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood, Florida</a> for KScope15 next year!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[My room view at the JW Marriott Hill Country Resort]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="My room view at the JW Marriott Hill Country Resort" src="/assets/images/marriott_room_view-0bef0fa5ab6aee91c5fe237b604c08ec.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
The much anticipated&nbsp;<a href="http://kscope13.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kscope 2013</a>&nbsp;conference will be starting soon in June this year. I felt it would be befitting to share my first-time experience at this event especially with anyone still procrastinating about signing up. This is after all, what Kscope is all about - sharing knowledge!</p><p>Kscope 2012 was for me, a trip with many firsts. It was my first visit to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=29.4166666667,-98.5&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=29.4166666667,-98.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Antonio, Texas</a> and I was extremely impressed. I was of course very delighted to have had a couple of hours in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=29.7627777778,-95.3830555556&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=29.7627777778,-95.3830555556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Houston</a> prior to arriving at my final destination. Just so I could have a quick lunch of BBQ pulled pork and a loaded potato. Tummy well-stocked for the next five days of intensive knowledge infusion.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Front entrance to the resort&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/marriott_lobby_view-3a02b6893bb080243ac0bab072ad05a8.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
The organizers at ODTUG certainly have great tastes when choosing a&nbsp;location to host the event. Last year, Kscope was held at the magnificent JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country. The views and ambience were breathtaking. Rooms were clean and service was top notch! Thank goodness I arrived a day early and managed to squeeze a quick tour of the compound and soaked up the warmth on a <a href="http://www.segway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Segway PT">Segway</a>!</p><p>The conference was well-packed with technical sessions covering a broad range of Oracle products and technologies. I really only had time to focus on topics on Oracle Application Express (APEX) and had hard enough time trying to figure out my schedule. Much of the APEX content focused on howtos and case studies. The <a href="http://apex.oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Oracle Application Express">Oracle APEX</a> team were also present in near fullforce to give you a glimpse of what is to come, and it was very useful to me in my career to plan ahead and build for the future.</p><p>There were also daily activities to keep you on your feet, for example, <a href="http://kentgraziano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Graziano</a>'s morning Chi Gung (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Qigong">Qi Gong</a>) sessions. Another personal favourite was the APEX Open Mic Night that was an hour-long (or more) session where the stage was open for any courageous APEX developer to showcase his/her current work. It's a real eye-opener for an APEX noob like me to learn about the exciting and creative ways that APEX has been used to deliver real-world apps.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;The signage outside the ballroom where I presented my session&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/door_signage-fcc08796f96b8978b13bcd7063e75e70.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
I was fortunate to have attended both Kscope and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/openworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Oracle OpenWorld">Oracle OpenWorld</a> and here's a quick comparison I'd like to make. The two&nbsp;events have a very different climate/atmosphere. OpenWorld felt like a huge roadshow and festival, whereas Kscope was pretty much a hobbyist's bootcamp. While both events provided an opportunity to meet key players in the Oracle world, Kscope was a much cosier setting and placed producers and consumers in close quarters.</p><p>Last but not least, I had the privilege to present at Kscope 2012 and was glad I did. I am an introvert and pessimist. Even though I had presented at conferences in the past, I still had the jitters as I knew I was in the company of&nbsp;intellectuals&nbsp;and experts. However the warmth of the organizers, attendees and community eased my fears knowing that everyone always had something good to share. It may not have been a full-house that day, but I was glad to be in the company of peers, colleagues and a very special guest. More importantly, I now feel a much greater desire to contribute to the developer community.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;A little competition always helps...&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/kscope_fun_n_games-68e24f2ce229ab20b7e70bc5e6cf58d9.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="img_ev3q">
Unfortunately, I would not be able to attend Kscope this year for varying reasons. If you can, then you should.I wish I could have written this sooner so that readers may take advantage of the early bird pricing. But better late than never. Besides, the friends you will make and knowledge gained will more than compensate the extra couple of hundred bucks. And if you do go, please consider volunteering either to assist at sessions or at the <a href="http://kscope13.com/events/community-service-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Service Day</a>. Last but not least, make lots of new friends, have great fun and I hope to meet you in-person at Kscope 14!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was very excited to receive my copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/rimple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring Roo in Action</a>. This is a fairly recent MEAP offering from Manning and is scheduled to be ready by the end of this year (2011). A 500-page quick-start guide, and IMHO, the missing manual for anyone interested in learning agile and rapid prototyping using Spring Roo.</p><p>Before I continue, some brief background about me and my experiences working with the <a href="http://www.springsource.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Spring Framework">Spring Framework</a>. I took an interest in Spring a couple of years ago while working on a web application to manage administrative data about a large-scale biotechnology research project. Not too long after starting on my project, I heard about Spring Roo. At that time, it was a rather new offering from <a href="http://www.springsource.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="SpringSource">SpringSource</a>, before version 1.0 was ready for prime time. It was and still is a great tool for very quickly developing straight-forward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Create, read, update and delete">CRUD</a> applications. However, my interest soon drained as I was concerned that the ease of development would compromise my ability to customise applications for customers. That opinion changed soon after reading this book. I'll explain later.</p><p>Ten chapters have been written so far, providing a comprehensive coverage of key component technologies that make the Spring Framework such a great technology for developing web and enterprise applications - database, web, messaging, integration and testing. Even with the ease of designing and configuring software using Spring - as the authors aptly point out - developers are often caught in a conumdrum of chosing the right set of frameworks. Often losing sight of our primary goals: building usable software that meets clients' expectations (and schedules).</p><p>However, as mentioned earlier, I was concerned that the Spring Roo was generating a lot of artifacts that are deeply intertwined with the tools, such that it becomes very difficult to customise without breaking any code. I liken this to a beginner .NET developer experience. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Microsoft Visual Studio">Visual Studio</a> was a very powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Integrated development environment">IDE</a> that allows anyone (well almost) to create usable applications in a short amount of time. That is definitely useful during early stages of development, where it was important to quickly prototype and impress your prospective customers. As time goes by, as we learn more and more about the user's requirements, we begin to realise that there's a fair amount of tweaking to be done. Then you're hooped.</p><p>I feel the authors were very conscious of this issue, and throughout the early chapters, assured me that there was a not-too-difficult exit strategy when the project needed more intricate plumbing: Push-In Refactoring. There is an entire chapter devoted to this topic and I certainly look forward to reading it when ready.</p><p>There's so much to say about this book, but I think my remaining thoughts are best condensed into these key points:</p><ul><li>The book is well written with the developer at heart. The authors exhibit great empathy with the many issues that developers face daily.</li><li>Well organised and covers all layers of the development cake.</li><li>Clear concise instructions, great visuals and easy to follow. All you need is a computer with tools installed to follow along.</li><li>Talks about IDE integration: SpringSource Tool Suite (STS) and IDEA's <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="IntelliJ IDEA">IntelliJ</a>. For STS, they don't just stop at the basics, there are some tips and tricks that could be very helpful in your development experience.</li><li>The authors don't just talk about all things Roo. There are some good pointers and guidance for software development and architecture considerations and best practices.</li><li>Chapter 11 is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Cloud computing">Cloud Computing</a>. I'm gonna guess that it has to do with CloudFoundry and the newly released MicroCloud. As developers and solution providers, as much as we hate buzz words, Cloud Computing is here to stay and I see this as a very important technology in the year ahead.</li></ul><p>Prior knowledge about the Spring Framework would be good, but definitely not a prerequisite. If Spring Roo is a beginner's portal into the world of Spring, then this book is your wormhole. If only I could give this must-have handbook a 5.01 rating!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was very excited to get my hands on a copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/owen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mahout in Action</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Artificial intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Machine learning">Machine Learning</a> are my most favourite subjects in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Computer science">Computer Science</a>. Back during my school days, AI and ML were primarily used in research, and sometimes banks use them for fraud detection. I am glad that it is gradually being adopted in mainstream businesses with the help of easy to use frameworks like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Apache Mahout">Mahout</a>, backed by commodity distributing platforms like <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Hadoop">Hadoop</a>.</p><p>The book is broadly organized into three main categories of algorithms currently implemented in Mahout: Recommendations, Clustering and Classification. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Author">authors</a> take a single strategy with each category. They begin with a general introduction, the algorithms available and basic examples. Later chapters go in depth on each group of algorithms with even more examples and measuring outcomes.</p><p>In many tutorial books and articles, we often find examples where data is magically pre-formatted for use and the outcome is pretty much orchestrated. I like the fact that the authors bother to go through the rigor of obtaining and preparing your data that includes cleaning, transformation etc. real-world data. Learning to pre-process your data is crucial for any successful ML application. Data sources are often "dirty". For ML algorithms to be useful, we must learn to deal with the imperfect world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Data collection">data collection</a>.</p><p>Many of the examples presented in the book are also familiar with most people, e.g. classifying news articles, recommending products, clustering Twitter users. I find real-world examples and common knowledge a great way to learn a new subject. Some of these examples might even be useful and can be applied to existing projects. Bear in mind that many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Data set">data sets</a> that they point you to are actual data collected from familiar websites and applications.</p><p>The authors also examine and provide examples on using Hadoop to support your Mahout implementation. As pointed out in the text, using ML techniques over large datasets often puts a strain on your computing resources. Mahout was designed from ground up to use Hadoop for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="High-performance computing">High Performance Computing</a>. You could buy a focused book to read about Hadoop (e.g. Hadoop in Action), but I find the coverage is sufficient enough to get you started. In the examples, again you will learn to prepare your data, not only for the analytics, but formulating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Data structure">data structure</a> that is compatible with Hadoop.</p><p>Learning about Machine Learning can be very daunting. It sometimes is dry and confusing for me, especially when books focus a lot on the Mathematics involved. I have found the authors approach to this field of Computer Science well balanced. There is enough details to get you started, but a whole lot more hand-holding, through examples, to demonstrate how ML can be useful in your projects.</p><p>In summary, this another great book to add to my fairly large collection of Machine Learning textbooks. Here's why:</p><ul><li>Authors are major contributors</li><li>Examples examples examples</li><li>Practical examples</li><li>Two books for the price of one</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many compelling reasons to get a copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/payette2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powershell in Action (2nd Edition)</a> but I will cover the important few. This is a great book currently in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Educational_Assessment_Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Michigan Educational Assessment Program">MEAP</a> process at Manning, and I believe, is pretty much near completion.</p><p>Before I talk about the book, a brief technical background about my interest in the subject matter. I am currently with an IT group focusing mostly on software development and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="High-performance computing">High Performance computing</a>. We are starting to deploy quite a few <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/R2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Windows Server 2008 R2">Windows 2008 R2</a> servers and gradually rolling out <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Windows">Windows</a> 7<!-- -->.<!-- --> We manage desktops outside of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=47.6395972222,-122.12845&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=47.6395972222,-122.12845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> suite of system administration capabilities and rely mostly on <a href="http://www.novell.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Novell">Novell</a> products. So I quite often get requests from my colleagues to write scripts to help configure desktop systems and remotely deploy applications.</p><p>So, the first reason to buy this book. It is written by Bruce Payette, a key person in the Powershell Team. Bruce is a great writer. The text is fluid, detailed and at times, humourous. You will find many useful quotes and codes! Well, the latter is more useful. I especially like the breakdowns telling you what each segment of a command does. You'll see a lot of this in DB2 and <a href="http://oracle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a> documentation that describe intricate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL</a> statements.</p><p>On to the second reason. Like many Manning ebooks that have successive editions, you get free access to the older versions. You might wonder how useful that is, but consider this: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Server 2008</a> (the first release) and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vista</a> still use Powershell v1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Hence if you are managing a heterogeneous environment containing both Windows 2008 and Windows 2008 R2, you might still want to keep the 1st edition for reference... just in case.</p><p>Now the meat... the book is divided into two parts. The first part covers most of the fundamentals, similar to how most other introductory books are structured. The first seven chapters are probably sufficient for you to write your first useful script (after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Hello world program">Helloworld</a>). If you have more demanding needs, Bruce looks at how you can distribute code and perform magical tasks remotely. Chapters 14 and 15 provides you the necessary skills to not wanna tear out your hair when your script misbehaves.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the author is very careful to describe textually, graphically and by example how things work in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/powershell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Windows PowerShell">PowerShell</a>. The amount of detail can sometimes make it rather dry to read, and that's why I particularly appreciate the occasional interjection of humour. Details are good.</p><p>Part 2 will probably be more useful to most, compared to earlier advanced topics discussed in Chapters 8 to 13... well, at least for me. Oh, and please read Chapter 21 on Security before you question and complain about why your scripts ain't running.</p><p>Last but not least, the Appendices. I have yet to receive them, but certainly looking forward to the much needed code samples (Appendix B) and quick reference sheets (Appendix C).</p><p>This review should come timely. During this holiday season, it is almost customary for Manning to be handing out free ebooks or at the very least, great discounts. This book deserves a 5/5 rating, so if you are keen on making Windows work harder for you, then this is a MUST read!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post follows my <a href="/content/id/88">earlier</a> review of the first six chapters of "Location Aware Applications". I recently received an update containing two new chapters covering topics on connectivity issues and how to monetize your LBS applications.</p><p>Chapter 7 briefly looks at issues affecting mobile devices that affect connectivity, e.g. acquisition rate of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</a> and battery consumption. A few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_%28programming%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Snippet (programming)">code snippets</a> in this chapter also demonstrates to the reader how you can obtain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Geolocation">geolocation</a> data from the different devices: <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="iPhone">iPhones</a>, Androids, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform%2C_Micro_Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Java Platform, Micro Edition">Java ME</a> and <a href="http://developer.palm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="WebOS">Palm WebOS</a> devices.</p><p>I like Chapter 8 the most so far. Well, who wouldn't? Software <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Software metric">metrics</a> has always been a challenging art - yes ART! So a  chapter that provides pointers on how to commercialize your application  is certainly welcomed!</p><p>The authors describe several ways of turning your application usage into cash churning machine. Several options on how to charge consumers for the use of your software are presented and includes many considerations - the pros and cons - for each method. I especially like Figure 8.2, a matrix for helping you decide which charging model best fits the type of application you have. Learned a few new keywords like "Long Tail Kings" and "Boot Campers".</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://manning.com/about/meap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manning Early Access Program</a>, or MEAP, is a program that allows you to purchase an electronic copy of a book even before it is published. This allows readers to participate in the development of the book's content. You will of course receive the final version of the book when it goes gold. I recently got my hands on a copy of the MEAP book, Location Aware Applications. At the time of this post, only 50% of the book has been completed. So here are my early impression of this upcoming title.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</a> and many other devices are becoming ubiquitous features in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mobile phone">cellular phones</a>. The availability of maps and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Application programming interface">APIs</a> to access geospatial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Data">data</a> are plenty. There is also increasing effort in making data open and linked, providing a multitude of information that can be consumed, meshed and presented to the mobile user. Thus it is no surprise that a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Computer software">software</a> developers (or not) are looking into making use of location-based information, hoping to spin some big bucks out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Technology">technology</a>.</p><p>If you are one of them, then this book might be for you. The authors provide a very good introduction for someone looking for headway into developing location-based, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Location awareness">location-aware</a> applications. Part 1 is a comprehensive overview of the history and development of LBS technologies and is very informative for newcomers. The beginning four chapters will also be a good refresher for experienced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Geographic information system">GIS</a> developers or geeks, so you might want to quickly glance through so that you are kept at the forefront of development. In chapters 3 and 4, the authors survey a broad range of content and mapping APIs with sample codes to showcase how they can be used. And this is a first I have seen: at the end of each code sample, the authors provide somewhat like a pseudocode to describe the program <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Control flow">flow</a>. This is very effective and helpful in understanding how the code works.</p><p>I do hope though that the authors might consider adding some introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Linked Data">LinkedData</a> and the <a href="http://semanticweb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Semantic Web">Semantic Web</a>, and how these novel developments might help spur more LBS applications.</p><p>That's it for now. I will update this post as more chapters are completed in the coming weeks/months. Stay tuned, or if you can't wait, grab a MEAP copy now! This book is available either from <a href="http://manning.com/ferraro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manning</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935182331?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fuzziebrain-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1935182331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
