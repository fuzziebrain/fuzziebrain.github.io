Note:
* Last couple of years, Big Data and IoT have been a huge.
* Data deluge also means machines are playing an increasing role in consuming data
* But HTML was designed for human consumption, not machines
* To glean data from websites, we build scrapers that lead to inaccurate data
* Alternatively, content creators need to design APIs
* REST an effective way to provide endpoints for machines to retrieve and sometimes, manipulate data
* But why not design data to be shared ground up?

## Not too long ago... <!-- .element: style="text-align: right; padding-right: 3em; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);" -->

Note:
* Why is this important? Bioinformatics is one of the earliest and more prominent adopters of Semantic Web technologies. That is how I got started.
* For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute hosts a RDF platform (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/) that contains datasets pertaining to protein, biological pathways and chemical compounds.
* Very often, projects begin with a simple goal of making the data available for other researches. However, when the same data is made available to machines to consume, it opens up a new range of innovation and automation. And this helps speeds up the scientific discovery process.

## Objectives
<ol>
<li>**Introduction** to the Semantic Web</li><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
<li>**Understand** how the technology might be relevant to **YOU**</li><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
<li>How to **apply** this technology in your **APEX** application</li><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
</ol>

Note:
* Gain a basic understanding of the Semantic Web such as:
** Architecture
** Standards and formats for representing data
** Ontology
** Reasoning
* Provide examples of day-to-day use of Sematic Web and how it impacts your application
* Last but not least, work through examples of how these technologies can be applied to APEX applications to make them provide much richer information, not just data.
