Highly recommend\n\nRating:\nFive\n\nReview:\nNot happy with these cameras. You start off by having to sign up for a free 30 day subscription trial. If you stay on the trial you don\u2019t actually know how the USB storage option works for recorded videos (if you don\u2019t want to continue with a monthly subscription for a monthly fee). So, I cancelled my free subscription so I could try the usb storage option rather than pay for subscription. This also allows me the flexibility to return it within 30 days. Interesting that you cannot \u201cpause\u201d free trial and reinstate later. Once cancelled you lose your free trial which seems like a gimmick.\n\nThe USB (not included) does work but, retrieving the videos is very slow and trying to access the cameras in \u201clive\u201d view sometimes does not work.\n\nThe daytime quality of cameras is ok but the night time quality is poor. Also, they are not weather resistant. I have mine protected under roofline but most mornings the cameras are blurry because of condensation despite having them in a somewhat protected area. We did also put one on a fence as they shown on the website but quickly had to remove it because of condensation build up (when it wasn\u2019t even raining).\nWill be returning. Not happy at all.\n\nRating:\nOne\n\nReview:\nIt's a decent camera system without a live view option for multiple cameras. Important: this kit includes the Sync Module already, I didn't see that listed anywhere so I bought separately the sync module and ended up with 2 of them.\n\nPros:\n- Able to communicate with people with 2-way communication.\n- Able to save video clips.\n- Easy to set up\n\nCons:\n- No constant live view. It's not like a traditional camera security system where you look at a monitor and see multiple cameras with a live view. You need to click on each camera and it will (slowly) load the view at that camera.\n- I haven't received any motion alerts. I have the sensitivity up high, I selected zones, I did everything they said to do and still no alerts for motion.\n- The camera quality is not like it is shown on the photos. The photos on Amazon are taken with a high end camera and made to look like they're the view of these cameras. It is nothing like the photos shown. Picture a digital camera from 2010. That is the image you'll get.\n\nRating returned as a json object with one attribute named rating:\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That then returns a result like this:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-json",children:'{\n    "rating": 3\n}\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Acknowledgement"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The text in the examples are actual reviews taken from Amazon."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At the moment, it seems to me that creating applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an expensive endeavor due to reliance on GPUs and ongoing supply chain issues, there are promising signs of change with growing interest in alternatives like Intel ARC and AMD Radeon.
