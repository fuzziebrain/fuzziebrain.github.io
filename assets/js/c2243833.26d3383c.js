I had imposed a limit on the number of coins a person could sponsor, and that was to help ensure a fair distribution of coins. That practice will continue going into 2020. What does that mean for folks who sponsored coins last year? For every coin that you had sponsored but have yet to submit a name, then that coin counts against your 2020 limit. For example, if you had sponsored three coins and submitted two names (and hopefully pictures) of the happy owners, then you'll have the opportunity to sponsor four this year.
